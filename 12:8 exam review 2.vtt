1
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.899
Danny Park: Alright. So

2
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.360
Danny Park: I'm showing our schedule for the semester on

3
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.780
Danny Park: the screen. Couple of changes. So I decided not to cover predictive analytics.

4
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.209
Danny Park: You'll get enough of that for those who are who are moving forward.

5
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.259
in your curriculums.

6
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:35.360
Danny Park: So I just wanna give just wanna give more team more time to kind of connect over for the group project I think I've seen just under half of the teams during office hours.

7
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.560
Danny Park: and for the ones I've seen. They look really good.

8
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:49.740
Danny Park: I think I think I mentioned like I was giving dra. I give draft grades during, and I don't think anyone got under like a draft grade of like an 83 or 82 like. They all look pretty good in the solid eighties.

9
00:00:49.750 --> 00:01:00.299
Danny Park: and you know, with with things that we discuss in office hours. If the team applies it, it'll definitely be in the nineties, I'm sure. So the group project, or seems like the group projects are go moving along. Well, I know there is

10
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.529
Danny Park: some more office hours for groups that requested. I mean, there's one tonight.

11
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.489
Danny Park: Which I'm excited for.

12
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:16.690
Danny Park: So if you for group pride for the group. the teams that haven't met with me for group projects yet.

13
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.430
Danny Park: I guess the only advice I could give at this point, just to

14
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.129
Danny Park: try, you know. Just if you need to meet with me, please submit a request cause

15
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.410
Danny Park: there are a couple of teams that be quested today, and I have

16
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:39.820
Danny Park: the earliest time I have is next week. So if you wait any longer, probably not, we won't be able to get office hours with me, as I, you know, as I shared multiple times before by just getting office hours in early.

17
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.999
Danny Park: So then, what you see here on the screen. What you see in green

18
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.670
Danny Park: is what's going to be covered

19
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.880
Danny Park: on the final exam.

20
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.050
Danny Park: Okay.

21
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.539
Danny Park: II we won't be reviewing

22
00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.299
Danny Park: the topics in green.

23
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:10.650
Danny Park: That's above exam. One, because you already have the recording. So I don't want to waste anyone's time, whatever we did for exam one review. Just go back and review it, because that's exactly what is going to be covered.

24
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:25.350
Danny Park: However, for the final exam. it's important to understand the 3 topics that we'll kind of review today. But to answer the final exam questions, well, you still have to bring in

25
00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.130
Danny Park: the concepts that's covered in the green boxes above.

26
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.870
Danny Park: Okay. So

27
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:52.139
Danny Park: as you study or review or watch the, you know the content and the course materials associated with the the the the 3 green boxes, you know the the recordings on blackboard. Think through how the stuff that is is being covered relates to each of the topics above.

28
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.260
Danny Park: Okay.

29
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.310
Danny Park: so exam logistics, same

30
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:07.780
Danny Park: logistics logistics like last time. So our final exam is is on the fifteenth. So basically, it's a next Friday.

31
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.290
Danny Park: I will have the exam on blackboard ready for download

32
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.670
Danny Park: at 5 50 PM.

33
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.640
Danny Park: And

34
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:28.529
Danny Park: you guys, are, you guys could do whatever you want? You could, you know, and start the exam whenever you want, you know, at 6 30, whatever, but the only requirement is to have it in by 9 Pm.

35
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.219
Danny Park: On the fifteenth

36
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:39.170
Danny Park: I will be on zoom like last time from 5 50 to 7, 15, to answer any questions

37
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.809
Danny Park: that you may have. You don't have to take the exam in the zoom room.

38
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:52.639
Danny Park: I'll just be there available for any anyone who needs to. You know, Clara, for me to clarify questions for them, you know. Typical exam setting.

39
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.860
Danny Park: However, I'm not gonna be in the zoom room after 7 15.

40
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:09.389
Danny Park: Okay, you you can still email me questions that you have. But I cannot guarantee you that. Yeah, I'll be able to answer your questions through email after 7, 15.

41
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.110
Danny Park: So I would, you know, just recommend that. Just start the exam at 5 50,

42
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.700
Danny Park: read the questions.

43
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.089
Danny Park: Make sure you understand it. If there's something that you don't understand, hop on to zoom and ask me a question. Live? And I'll and I'll answer.

44
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:24.380
Yeah.

45
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:34.299
Danny Park: And it's a 5 essay question format, just like exam one. So let me stop here any questions around exam logistics and what's covered.

46
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:44.909
Walt Black: Professor, I just have one question. Is it still open? Note for the Yup Yup open book

47
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:57.910
Danny Park: are open recording lecture recording open script. I guess you could download the script as well. for sure. But I'll just kinda just remind everyone.

48
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.279
Danny Park: Do not put

49
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.639
Danny Park: your answers through any translation

50
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.760
Danny Park: service

51
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.770
Danny Park: definitely. Not do chat, Gpt do not

52
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.140
Danny Park: use websites

53
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:20.190
Danny Park: to. I don't know. I think one student before was telling tell me how he was using a website

54
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:31.269
Danny Park: to help structure the way he wanted to answer that that really didn't make sense. To me that just seemed like just plagiarism. That's in the way. Another way of saying plagiarism.

55
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.560
Danny Park: so

56
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.830
Danny Park: you could use everything that we covered in the course.

57
00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:55.819
Danny Park: But write it in your own thoughts and words, because everyone here is highly intelligent. Don't delegate your intelligence to a website or chat Gp to anything else. We build these things. Human intelligence does. So we have to get out of the practice of delegating our intelligence to tools.

58
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.589
Danny Park: because the more we practice.

59
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:10.360
Danny Park: especially as and Mbas delegating our intelligence, we are no longer business leaders. We're just followers. You're not going to be competitive. If you are, train yourself to follow a tool.

60
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:25.160
Danny Park: Okay? Cause you don't know what that tool is built on. You have no idea if what it's providing you is top level intelligence or like leadership, worthy things. So leaders always aspire to think of things that are not discovered yet

61
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.670
Danny Park: right, and part of your answer should be, should be teasing beyond that.

62
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:34.389
Danny Park: Alright. So just this. Let's keep that in mind. Second thing about translation.

63
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.829
Danny Park: I don't grade you on your language skills. That's not my job.

64
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:47.480
Danny Park: In fact, to get into the and Mba program, every single student has to go through the yeah. You know, I think they take the the language test.

65
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.110
Danny Park: right? So

66
00:06:50.120 --> 00:07:01.410
Danny Park: there's you should not be afraid that I'm gonna like, look over your English language skills and start docking points. I kinda I am sensitive to

67
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:06.380
Danny Park: people's language barriers. And I do catch that when I grade the exams.

68
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.100
Danny Park: Okay, however, grammar and formatting

69
00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.849
Danny Park: things that are completely off right then. That's what I would, you know.

70
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:21.519
Danny Park: really kind of look into figuring out what's what's going on. and look to see if if the the essence is there.

71
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.789
So let me just state that

72
00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:41.660
Danny Park: to make sure that I have old international students kinda like, you know, the ones who are English, not your primary language is not, is not your first. But I'll say this, though, as you graduate as you continue your Mba curriculum, and you graduate, and you want to get a competitive offer here in the States. They do assess your English skills.

73
00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:43.490
Danny Park: I know I do

74
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:46.910
Danny Park: right. So on the journey

75
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:54.720
Danny Park: of the Mba curriculum. If you know you have some deficiency in English, right? Either written or writing, or listening or understanding.

76
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.440
Danny Park: you can't sit during an interview and put

77
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:23.500
Danny Park: use a tool to answer questions. So I would. I would highly suggest that you practice as often as you can, and not use translation devices or tools during exams. Cause you just need to practice speaking, live using the right grammar in the right context, using the English. If you want to work in the States, of course, right for those who don't wanna work in the States. And you wanna go back to home countries like just whatever I said, just forget about it. But if you wanna work in the States.

78
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:38.330
Danny Park: a huge competitive factor, differentiated is going to be English language. And that goes for both international students and local students. Right? If you you know, if you grew up in the United States and you still don't have a good good vocabulary. And you don't understand. Like.

79
00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:43.970
Danny Park: when leaders speak to you like, that's gonna be deficiency as well. So always just always practice

80
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.219
Danny Park: communication skills and don't take shortcuts.

81
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.790
Danny Park: Alright. So that's the exam logistics.

82
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.839
Danny Park: some guardrails. I just shared any questions on that.

83
00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:01.870
Danny Park: because if I and I just, I'll just put out the warning. Now, if

84
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:08.170
Danny Park: if some, if it comes back as plagiarized, just like exam. One.

85
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:10.850
Danny Park: there is no time for makeup.

86
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.010
Danny Park: Okay? So I just want to make sure that that's that's very clear. Alright.

87
00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:29.429
Danny Park: alright. So there's there's no questions, no comments. Let's just move on to our review material. I you know, I promise again. It's not gonna be that long, because it's only 3 things.

88
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:40.819
Danny Park: And so let's pick up the first one alright. So this slide or this deck, this topic that we cover data driven mindset and deploying business analytics.

89
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:43.170
Danny Park: This is very important.

90
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:45.390
Danny Park: Okay.

91
00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.010
Danny Park: understanding

92
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.920
Danny Park: how a business analytic project.

93
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.430
Danny Park: whatever could call business analytics, a decision making process, right

94
00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:06.199
Danny Park: or strategic thinking, whatever you want to call it. It's business analytics, like consulting same thing. It's business analytics. There has to be rigor

95
00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:16.130
Danny Park: and quality checks along the 3 phases of this. So this slide actually captures a lot of the essence of what it means to be

96
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:20.120
Danny Park: or run a business analytic project.

97
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:28.260
Danny Park: Right? So what this is, what we have to do is we have to understand what's happening now. So what is the current state

98
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:37.609
Danny Park: to be able to move on and figure out anything right, just like how, before you want to go to Berouk and go to school

99
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:41.189
Danny Park: right and make it for class. Where do you need to know.

100
00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:47.310
Danny Park: for example, you need to know what time it is now? Right? So let's say, I have class at 6 PM.

101
00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:57.339
Danny Park: And I go. What time is it now? Oh, 3 pm. Okay, I have 3 h to get there, right? So that's an example of trying. You have to understand where you are today, to plan

102
00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.460
Danny Park: to achieve the goal

103
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.360
Danny Park: of getting to class.

104
00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:10.740
Danny Park: Right? So have to understand what's happening route now. And you do your business analysis.

105
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:14.060
Danny Park: right? Which we have the tool set for

106
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.010
Danny Park: after you figure out

107
00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:28.500
Danny Park: based on the data set you have at that current time. after you do your business analysis to figure out what's actually going on and what the actual business problem is.

108
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:49.839
Danny Park: That's when you could, you can start layering in the data analytics. So when we talk about business analysis, business analysis also includes data analysis meaning just looking at the data and the business situation. And you understand you coming to a conclusion that you understand everything like you have all the facts. You understand the circumstances.

109
00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.760
Danny Park: and you have all the key data attributes that you need to do your analytics.

110
00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:05.280
Danny Park: So after you do data data analytics, right? And that's gonna be usually descriptive analytics to find out what's happening now in the current state.

111
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.359
Danny Park: you're going to get a set of answers.

112
00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:15.170
Danny Park: So before you move on to the next phase of a business analytic project

113
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.849
Danny Park: or your decision. You know your strategic decision making process.

114
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:25.489
Danny Park: You have to go back and say, Hey, are, do our answers make sense

115
00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:36.669
Danny Park: right? And the quality of your answer is going to be the rigor and discipline and the quality of the actions that you did at the business analysis layer and the data analytics layer

116
00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:40.710
Danny Park: within that phase. Right? Cause if you

117
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:45.980
Danny Park: let's say you missed a key business fact. Right? Your answer is going to be off.

118
00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:50.229
Danny Park: Let's say you ha! You missed a key data attribute

119
00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:54.799
Danny Park: right or factor. When I say your data set was incomplete.

120
00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.560
Danny Park: Right? Your answer is going to be off.

121
00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.269
Let's say you use the wrong descriptive analytic

122
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.550
Danny Park: method.

123
00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.390
Danny Park: Right? Your answer will be off.

124
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:11.830
Danny Park: So the quality of the answers at each phase

125
00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:20.859
Danny Park: provided input to the overall quality right? So you could just do it like a mathematic equation. Right? Let's say

126
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:31.520
Danny Park: 50% up, you know. Let's say you have 50% confidence that you answers in the in the descriptive analytic phase. Right? What's happening now

127
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.570
Danny Park: is 50% good.

128
00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:39.360
Danny Park: Then if you multiply that against, let's say the next 2

129
00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:54.150
Danny Park: answers, that's it. If the second phase answer 100%, and the last phase right, what you should do is another 100 right. The total quality of your answers is not a hundred percent, because it's 50 times a hundred times 100.

130
00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:01.680
Danny Park: So if you think about it that way. your current state of what you do today. Well, what you know

131
00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:06.259
Danny Park: is the most important phase of a business analytic project

132
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.580
Danny Park: cause. As you move forward, it's almost like

133
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:16.470
Danny Park: every step of the way, let's say you're you're trying to get from where you are to school.

134
00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:21.830
Danny Park: Right? Imagine, instead of knowing

135
00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:26.819
Danny Park: what your situation's today. Right? Let's say it's it's it's

136
00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:33.010
Danny Park: class is 6 pm. It's 3 pm. Now. right? You know, it takes an hour to get to school

137
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.369
Danny Park: right? And then

138
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.800
Danny Park: let's say you didn't know it was 3 pm. For example.

139
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:46.369
Danny Park: right, you're missing that data set right, and you leave at that moment right? Clearly. You're going to arrive there too early.

140
00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.420
Danny Park: right at the end. So when you arrive there too early.

141
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:53.170
Danny Park: you're waiting for class. You're standing around. That's idle time.

142
00:14:53.220 --> 00:15:01.170
Danny Park: meaning that you're not doing anything productive. So you lost out in all that productive time. So that's like an example of what can happen if you

143
00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:19.720
Danny Park: miss key factors and data up from the beginning. So that's what this is saying eventually is like, hey, like, just make sure that each phase you understand, and you're doing the right analysis. So you can do the right analytics to get to the best answer possible

144
00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:27.259
Danny Park: to move on so at the end. Your strategy and your plan that you want to execute is

145
00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:37.379
Danny Park: what you actually should do. Sort of probability of winning in the market depends on the strength of your strategy and your planning.

146
00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.269
Danny Park: Okay, so let me stop here real quick. Any questions on this slide.

147
00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.630
Danny Park: Alright moving on.

148
00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:01.290
Danny Park: So this is the same slides that you skip, slide 4.

149
00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.090
Danny Park: So slide 5.

150
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:16.039
Danny Park: Important. Right? We talk about the digital mindset. Right? So the digital mindset reason why it's so important is because when you go back and ask yourself, Hey, Danny, like, okay, you're telling us that

151
00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:18.890
Danny Park: we need to be very good here

152
00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:24.490
Danny Park: to understand or collect data

153
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:33.099
Danny Park: to a degree that we know to a certain confidence interval that our data is of good quality.

154
00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:43.110
Danny Park: Right? So it sounds easy. But in organization, let's say, for, like Ppwc, we have 20,000 individuals in in Pwc right in the Us alone.

155
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.849
Danny Park: So how can organization

156
00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:57.580
Danny Park: ensure that as many people in the organization possible are participating in an effective and efficient way to this data, analytic

157
00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:00.470
Danny Park: process or business analytic process.

158
00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.879
Danny Park: right? And we talked about how to do that.

159
00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:15.489
Danny Park: Most organizations that are that perform very well. They they adopt this thing called the digital mindset, where they teach each employee

160
00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:22.640
Danny Park: about how important it is to take a data centric view of everything they do.

161
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.550
Danny Park: So.

162
00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:35.089
Danny Park: to sum up, what digital mindset example of of it would be, is it? Let's say I'm going into like just today. I had had a strategic Pre. A pre-planning strategic meeting

163
00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:38.229
Danny Park: for strategic workshops next week

164
00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:40.499
Danny Park: that I have coming up.

165
00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:45.270
Danny Park: So had a meeting set and had an agenda written down

166
00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.470
Danny Park: right. I didn't have it written down on paper.

167
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.499
Danny Park: I noted it in a digital format

168
00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:57.340
Danny Park: right? And then, when we're on the actual meeting. I wasn't on the meeting

169
00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:08.229
Danny Park: and I didn't tell one of my seniors to start taking manual notes and then write it in the email afterward. Right? Although that's that's good taking notes.

170
00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:19.840
Danny Park: But from a digital mindset perspective with the understanding of data quality. I know that the quality of what's going to be written. Is it going to be equal to

171
00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:33.209
Danny Park: the attention span and the skill sets, and the business knowledge of the person to take in the notes. So I have a senior associate doing. For example, right, let's say, had a senior associate doing it. The senior associate is usually 2 years in the business.

172
00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:38.509
Danny Park: so, as the senior associates is taking, taking his or her notes.

173
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.680
Danny Park: The business understanding is limited.

174
00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:49.999
Danny Park: So I how can I expect this person, with only 2 years in the business, be able to translate

175
00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:54.409
Danny Park: what she or he is hearing from top senior partners

176
00:18:56.020 --> 00:19:04.859
Danny Park: to a degree where what's going to be written and captured is not only in the spirit of the context of the meeting. But it's also accurate.

177
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:17.309
Danny Park: So I know that the probability of that right, the accuracy of what's gonna be was to be written down, and the capture of the, you know, capturing of the spirit in the context of meeting

178
00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:21.099
Danny Park: is not going to yield me a pretty good data set.

179
00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:27.970
Danny Park: So my option leveraging my understanding of of again data quality

180
00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:29.520
Danny Park: and digital mindset.

181
00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:32.099
Danny Park: I used teams, co-pilot.

182
00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:34.320
Danny Park: and I recorded the meeting.

183
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.430
Danny Park: and everything is digitized.

184
00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.850
Danny Park: Right? So

185
00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:50.929
Danny Park: is it 100% perfect? No, but it's better than having a human being with limited business knowledge. Take the notes and date like basically create data

186
00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.859
Danny Park: that it's probably gonna be maybe at most 60%

187
00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.740
Danny Park: confident, meaning 60% good enough.

188
00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:03.320
Danny Park: Whereas if I use technology and actually digitize it the right way

189
00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:07.569
Danny Park: with the best way possible. The confidence interval

190
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:20.319
Danny Park: of that data that's captured is probably around like 95, 90, 95. So if you compare 2 teams. Let's say my team is competing against another team. Right? I already have the edge.

191
00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:29.350
Danny Park: Because and when I start writing my descriptive analytic phase, I have a better data set than the other team.

192
00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:33.360
Danny Park: So my answer here

193
00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.909
Danny Park: will be better than the answer of that competitor.

194
00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:48.869
Danny Park: So that competitor has to. A couple of things has to catch up to match my quality at the very end here.

195
00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.220
Danny Park: So ha! Where do we see that in real life?

196
00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:58.030
Danny Park: Oh, you! We see it in everyday, in products. There's some products that's better than others

197
00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:02.050
Danny Park: that meet user requirements that just more strongly

198
00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:07.209
Danny Park: right. A good example, like a really good example is the iphone versus a blackberry

199
00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:14.380
Danny Park: right? Blackberry and I like. These are the blackberry and the iphone of both mobile technologies.

200
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:17.800
Danny Park: But the iphone just had did a better job of capturing user data.

201
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:28.740
Danny Park: So they are better here. They knew exactly what functions and capabilities that users wanted. In version one version, 2 version, 3 blackberry

202
00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:39.390
Danny Park: they were. Datasets are complete. They're doing and running analytics is completely off, like, Oh, our users want this. Our users want that our users want want a type, a type keyboard thing on the top of the phone

203
00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:56.059
Danny Park: and at Blackberry. I don't know if you guys are old enough to remember blackberry. But Blackberry went away. They're the dominant mobile business phone. And because they didn't understand how to capture data meaning their organization wasn't really paying attention to digital mindset.

204
00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:58.430
Danny Park: They got out competed.

205
00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:05.460
Danny Park: And Apple, who went from just making laptops, became a dominant force in business, mobile phones.

206
00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:12.419
Danny Park: Right? So that's

207
00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.760
Danny Park: why the digital minds is very important.

208
00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:23.789
Danny Park: Right? So then. how do you ingrain? Right? Well, how do you actually

209
00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:35.140
Danny Park: implement or apply the digital mindset right? And there is a concept or or a a a practice called digital literacy.

210
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:46.819
Danny Park: Right? Just getting your team access to tools and technologies is not good enough to say that they have a digital mindset.

211
00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:54.929
Danny Park: And I think we talked about that in class right? How many people here use excel at work, but don't really know how to write a Vba code

212
00:22:55.810 --> 00:23:07.609
Danny Park: cause excel was created right. I mean initially, the first excel was just a spreadsheet that you could use simple math. But Microsoft was adding more layers into the actual application.

213
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.489
Danny Park: So users

214
00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:15.810
Danny Park: can learn how to do basic Vba code and automate the worksheet process.

215
00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:29.540
Danny Park: But how many of you who use excel, right, have multiple versions of the same workbook, don't version control, and the actual tool itself causes more rework.

216
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:35.880
Danny Park: How many people get so fed up with excel. They actually do work, offline on excel. They go back to paper

217
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:52.410
Danny Park: right? Or instead of writing or tagging each other in notes and comments in excel. They write emails. So now, if you want to reference something in an Excel file, you have to go shuffle through your email to figure out what that cell is saying

218
00:23:53.300 --> 00:24:01.189
Danny Park: is, they're just having a comment in there. Right? So that's an example of how organizations are buying technologies. But their staff are not literate.

219
00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:05.799
Danny Park: They don't know the actual purpose behind the technology.

220
00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:15.489
Danny Park: Because if you know what the purpose of excel is which is for the user to automate the entire data analytic process

221
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.520
Danny Park: within a given worksheet.

222
00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:27.669
Danny Park: and in real time communicate with stakeholders who need to be informed of the analytics in that excel sheet

223
00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:39.319
Danny Park: because you can write basic vba codes where, when you run that excel file, it will send notes to people who need to know that new, that new analytic that's been run the new numbers.

224
00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:44.549
Danny Park: But instead, I see people download.

225
00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:45.700
Danny Park: excel.

226
00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:59.809
Danny Park: and then upload it back into an email and then send it off the people. and people never read their emails. So they come to meetings and they go. Oh, I didn't get a chance to look at the excel, or did you send me the excel when

227
00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:02.330
Danny Park: oh, I don't have it! Can you resend it to me?

228
00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:12.669
Danny Park: So visual literacy has access has use meaning, you know how to use

229
00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:14.520
Danny Park: the tool

230
00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:18.170
Danny Park: meaning. It's most valuable capabilities.

231
00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:23.640
Danny Park: not just opening up a tab and typing stuff in a table and then color coding

232
00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:33.459
Danny Park: right? You know how to use the most valuable capabilities of that tool within the context of what you need to do within your role

233
00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:37.370
Danny Park: after you understand how to use it

234
00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:46.330
Danny Park: right? Then you start mastering it. Then you start understanding like, oh, this is what the tool does. So I could use it for this. I could. So you're you're becoming innovative.

235
00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:49.170
Danny Park: You're using a tool in different ways.

236
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:58.309
Danny Park: or for those who truly master the technology. You're figuring out what it doesn't provide you at the next level.

237
00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:09.500
Danny Park: So you're providing feedback to Microsoft, saying, Hey, it'd be great if you can actually have a plugin that brings in all the python libraries.

238
00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:11.449
Danny Park: Oh, we didn't think about that.

239
00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:18.330
Danny Park: Yeah, cause I'm and I've learned your tool. I'm very advanced and mastered it, and I'm looking to do more.

240
00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:34.070
Danny Park: So then, after there's the mastery of the tool, then you could actually start truly creating content. So from a digital literacy perspective, when you, when we mean you're creating content. We're meaning that you're driving new value.

241
00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:39.700
Danny Park: So the tool is not just a cost play. meaning.

242
00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:56.470
Danny Park: if you use excel again, I'm just using sales as an example, because I think everyone here has used excel before, like, you know, like, you guys need to pretty know very well if your organization has excel, and all you're doing is doing spreadsheets with it. You're basically paying a license for that tool.

243
00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:00.650
Danny Park: And you're not generating any value from it. It's just a cost.

244
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:14.250
Danny Park: But if you have enough, your team members who've mastered a tool and they start using it in different ways and new ways and expediting work and finding efficiency and productivity. Then you're generating value from that tool.

245
00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:24.800
Danny Park: So creation in the digital literacy perspective means you're generating value meaning you're getting your money back of the license cost, and you're making money from it.

246
00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:38.039
Danny Park: So if you and you guys could do this, you could just do this exercise at work. Go, go to work open, go to all the excel files that's in your folders.

247
00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:45.669
Danny Park: and ask yourselves how many of those excel files that you have actually generated or helped generate some type of revenue.

248
00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.439
Danny Park: It's probably gonna be 0 for many of you.

249
00:27:54.040 --> 00:28:06.000
Danny Park: right as again, not your fault, but as Mbas. That's how, as Mbas in analytics and technology leaders, that's how we have to view our technology suite of products.

250
00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:09.920
Danny Park: we can't just buy to give them something

251
00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:20.380
Danny Park: we have to give them everything else on top to be able to be for them, for them to be digitally literate once you're literate and dig in technologies.

252
00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:28.990
Danny Park: That's when you're feeding your analytic process that your firm has.

253
00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:34.730
Danny Park: So that's how the concepts tie in. And that's how it ties into data quality.

254
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:42.820
Danny Park: The quality of the data that your firm has is equal to how well its employees use

255
00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.790
Danny Park: technologies to generate data

256
00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:55.230
Danny Park: because there's a lot of information and knowledge that's not captioned in datasets that you need it to be in there for you to be able to run

257
00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:59.169
Danny Park: your business analytic project to get to the right strategy and plan.

258
00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:04.810
So going back to Blackberry, they had a lot of missing data and information.

259
00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:08.129
Danny Park: So their strategy and plan was always going to be off.

260
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:17.000
Danny Park: and when they're going total toe with apple apple demolished them into literally oblivion

261
00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:27.500
Danny Park: to a degree. We could borrow those concepts and apply it to our careers.

262
00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:33.270
Danny Park: So if everyone, if you, if you really want to let this sink in, you could sink it in that way

263
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:41.410
Danny Park: the way our the world is moving. We're moving to a very data centric world

264
00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:48.170
Danny Park: where now we're competing with tools that are fed with data and knowledge that we probably don't understand or know.

265
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:51.309
Danny Park: So we have to figure out

266
00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.619
Danny Park: how to specialize in a particular area.

267
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:59.720
Danny Park: to remain competitive enough to have a very lucrative and long-term career.

268
00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:03.629
Danny Park: especially especially for those who are getting their Mbas.

269
00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:15.770
Danny Park: So a good takeaway from this slide would be is doing a true assessment of your current situation, saying, right, you're gonna apply business analytics to yourself. And you're gonna say.

270
00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:18.739
Danny Park: am I? Do? I actually know

271
00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:22.460
Danny Park: some technology very well

272
00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:31.739
Danny Park: that I can turn into a competitive advantage

273
00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:44.060
Danny Park: meaning. It's gonna make me money, right? Because a job is make you make as professionals. We make our money through getting our employment and our raises and our bonuses and everything else.

274
00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:56.500
Danny Park: So the same concepts that you see that we're covering today. It's it's it's a is a business concept that extends to us individually, because we're all business people. We are our own business.

275
00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.170
Danny Park: So after

276
00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:06.900
Danny Park: you teach your staff or yourself or your organization about what digital mindset is

277
00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:09.910
Danny Park: right. You have to start digitizing

278
00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:19.879
Danny Park: right? Then you could digitalize right? So I won't go through definitions here. I will. You know.

279
00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:25.409
Danny Park: you guys read it yourselves, and we covered it before in the last recording. But this is a very important concept, too.

280
00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:27.400
Danny Park: Okay?

281
00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:36.720
Danny Park: Because if we don't digitize, we can't digitalize.

282
00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:40.489
Danny Park: And if you can't digitalize, you can't digitally transform

283
00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:47.790
Danny Park: right. And many people, many organizations.

284
00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:52.299
Danny Park: When they say that we're in digital transformation.

285
00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:57.190
Danny Park: Most often they confuse themselves

286
00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:07.489
Danny Park: when they're actually in digitization, you can't be taking manual things and turning them into digitized format. And to say you're digitally transforming

287
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:29.099
Danny Park: digital transformation, as the definition says, is a series of deep and coordinated culture workforce and technology shifts that enable new educational and operating models and transform an institutions, operations, strategic direction and value proposition. So I use an example of Pwc of why, ha! Our digital transformation efforts?

288
00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.230
Danny Park: 20 years ago

289
00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:40.360
Danny Park: we went through an exercise of of understanding that. Oh, you know what a lot of our things are. Not really, that digitized

290
00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:46.470
Danny Park: lot of stuff is still manual, I mean, in in heavy paper.

291
00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.940
Danny Park: So we have to make an effort to digitize as much as we can.

292
00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:55.090
Danny Park: Right? So if you go to, if you go to this slide, we're like somewhere in the yellow

293
00:32:57.030 --> 00:33:15.889
Danny Park: fast forward, right? We digitize a lot right? We captured a lot of information. We automated processes right? We bought in Uipath. We did, you know, advanced Vba code. But in other process, tools and other value chains. And we started to streamline processes.

294
00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:19.410
Danny Park: We did all that. Now, today.

295
00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:23.250
Danny Park: we're probably one of the only firms.

296
00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:30.489
Danny Park: actually like a handful of firms where we have our own instance of generative generative AI in the organization.

297
00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:40.450
Danny Park: and that has streamlined our way of work, our culture, how we we have a complete digital workforce that's not human.

298
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:48.900
Danny Park: We rolled out initiatives called myplus and the new equation to give more power

299
00:33:48.940 --> 00:34:00.390
Danny Park: to our human employees for them to figure out how they want to move around their careers with this new technology that came into place. So we're letting everyone re-engineer how they want to work.

300
00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:06.249
Danny Park: So there's no way we could have brought in Pwfc. Chat

301
00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:12.000
Danny Park: our version of Gen. AI. Without doing all the other work here

302
00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:23.229
Danny Park: and to do all this stuff here we have to still abide by the same things. We have to understand what information systems are right, that that the the how one ripple a one

303
00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:26.929
Danny Park: thing that happens in the people component can affect the data component.

304
00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:32.469
Danny Park: We have to understand infrastructure. We have to understand data quality and data strategy.

305
00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:35.910
Danny Park: We have to be digital mindset and digitally literate.

306
00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:41.239
Danny Park: Right? We had to digitize, then digital lies, then do digital transformation.

307
00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:45.120
Danny Park: So all these things that we covered right here.

308
00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:49.320
Danny Park: They all are interrelated to one another.

309
00:34:52.530 --> 00:35:00.320
Danny Park: And all those things that we do feeds our world class. This is analytic

310
00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:03.010
Danny Park: project methodology.

311
00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:14.919
Danny Park: Okay, so that's slide 9. Don't worry about slide 10

312
00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.570
Danny Park: any questions so far.

313
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:26.540
Danny Park: Alright.

314
00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:37.380
Danny Park: So the next slide so slides 13 to 17. It's important because we have to understand how to structure a business analytic project.

315
00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:48.310
Danny Park: because a structure that you see here is what in Slide 13 and 14 is what ensures that each phase is run with high quality.

316
00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:52.030
Danny Park: So that's slide 13 and 14

317
00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:57.580
Danny Park: and then slide 1516. Don't worry about

318
00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:02.099
Danny Park: and slide 17 is important.

319
00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:11.149
Danny Park: Okay? Because sometimes when you're running your business. So the business analysis

320
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:15.989
Danny Park: and your data analysis is meant to discover if you have any gaps.

321
00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:21.359
Danny Park: So these are a list of the most common gaps

322
00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:27.100
Danny Park: that an organization would find as they run their analysis, toolkit.

323
00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:35.580
Danny Park: Ignoring these gaps. right is a recipe for disaster.

324
00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:44.779
Danny Park: So a good way to think about it is if you are ever running a data analytic project, or you have a data analytic team where consulted team present to you their findings.

325
00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:56.230
Danny Park: And then you asked him this one question, did you discover any gaps during your analysis? And how did you fill it? And if they ever come back with like there are. There are no gaps for us to for us that we found.

326
00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:59.870
Danny Park: I would pretty much guarantee you that they didn't do any analysis.

327
00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:09.469
Danny Park: and that whatever they're presenting to you the conf the confidence interval, meaning the probability of their solutions being successful is going to be pretty low

328
00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:15.660
Danny Park: compared to a competitor who actually did a robust and rigorous analysis phase

329
00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:22.060
Danny Park: alright.

330
00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:27.760
Danny Park: So that's it. For this slide deck before we move on last call for questions.

331
00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:33.490
Danny Park: Alright.

332
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:37.090
Danny Park: Then let's get into the tool set

333
00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:47.859
Danny Park: right. So there's not gonna be a lot of you know. I'm not gonna revisit a lot lot of slides and topics. But I'm just gonna point out some important things right? First one.

334
00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:50.420
Danny Park: And this kind of relates to everyone's

335
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:52.109
Danny Park: project through a project.

336
00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:58.840
Danny Park: You have to find the actual problem statement.

337
00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:05.289
Danny Park: The problem statement most often is not

338
00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:09.250
Danny Park: the high level comment or

339
00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:14.650
Danny Park: the business problem that someone tends to tell you that that's what their problem is.

340
00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:18.309
Danny Park: The problem statement is the

341
00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:19.610
Danny Park: root cause

342
00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:26.099
Danny Park: of what a stakeholder is stressing to you. That is causing them

343
00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:28.580
Danny Park: some level of dysfunction

344
00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:35.570
Danny Park: right? An example of this that we used last time I'll go through it again is is easiest. One is going to a doctor

345
00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:39.239
Danny Park: when you go to a doctor, and you complain about a fever

346
00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.949
Danny Park: right? A very bad doctor.

347
00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:48.069
Danny Park: we'll just say, go take aspirin and Tylenol drink some water. Get out of here.

348
00:38:49.210 --> 00:39:02.759
Danny Park: Right? Because why? Because we know, because we all been sick before right, that our headache can be a symptom of a more under deeper, underlying problem.

349
00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:05.380
Danny Park: Right? It could be dehydration.

350
00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:12.789
Danny Park: It could be kidney failure. It could be cancer. It could be a flu right. It could be so many things.

351
00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:22.619
Danny Park: So a good doctor. They ask 5. Y's right. The concept of 5 y's, they keep asking questions to tease out more symptoms

352
00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:28.559
Danny Park: to where the pattern of symptoms discovered

353
00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:43.980
Danny Park: will eventually lead to the actual cause right? And sometimes, when a doctor asks the questions and gets more information, even though if the doctor can't identify the root cause. Doctor knows, hey? I know exactly what test to run.

354
00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:59.129
Danny Park: meaning. I know exactly what analytics to do to give me more clues as to what the root cause is of your sickness, because I don't want to misdiagnose you, because if you have actually have cancer and I miss it, you will die.

355
00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:01.000
Danny Park: the headache will lead to death.

356
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:06.940
Danny Park: So a business a bit when a business is sick

357
00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:09.770
Danny Park: meaning a business is not making money.

358
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:16.890
Danny Park: and you can think of it that way when a human being is sick, reason why is very bad for society is that when people get sick we're not productive

359
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:22.160
Danny Park: when we're not productive. We're not generating any value. When a society doesn't generate value.

360
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:27.169
Danny Park: Right? That's when societies fail. It's the same concept with business.

361
00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:31.120
Danny Park: Sick businesses don't make money

362
00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:35.350
Danny Park: because they're dysfunctional. they're unproductive.

363
00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:38.730
Danny Park: So an Mba.

364
00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:50.180
Danny Park: they're supposed to understand how to discover the root cause of the sickness and provide the right medicine to alleviate the root cause which goes gets rid of all the symptoms.

365
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:57.080
Danny Park: Because if I have a headache and the doctor missed the fact, I have cancer

366
00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:04.129
Danny Park: and solution's my symptom of a headache. Guess what my cancer still there and my other symptoms are still there.

367
00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:17.009
Danny Park: so your poor doctor would keep giving me. Hey! Take this therapy, then that therapy, then this medicine, that medicine right without addressing the actual cancer. Maybe I need surgery to remove the tumor.

368
00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.929
Danny Park: Then boom! I'm alive again. I'm productive now.

369
00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:25.779
Danny Park: instead of the cancer festering

370
00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:38.440
Danny Park: right? And so for years I'm just in pain and being less productive until I go away like a business for years, you. So you just bleed money and don't make money until you dissolve.

371
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:41.760
Danny Park: That's because they didn't have any good. Mbas.

372
00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:46.680
Danny Park: who understood how to get to the actual group problem.

373
00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:54.399
Danny Park: Everything starts with getting to the root problem. You cannot analyze that or solution anything without understanding what the proof problem is.

374
00:41:54.910 --> 00:42:00.729
Danny Park: if you do, yeah short term, you might get some wins. But long term, your company's gonna fail, blackberry.

375
00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:06.989
Danny Park: So how do you find the prom statement.

376
00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:11.839
Danny Park: Right? You run your analysis, the business analysis, your squat.

377
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.350
Danny Park: your pesto

378
00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:17.900
Danny Park: right, your risk analysis.

379
00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:22.280
Danny Park: your competitor analysis.

380
00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:26.320
Danny Park: because sometimes your environment might be causing issues for you.

381
00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:31.280
Danny Park: Right?

382
00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:34.070
Danny Park: Also, like I I'm seeing like

383
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:35.850
Danny Park: bug bytes everywhere.

384
00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:43.229
Danny Park: What am I gonna do? I'm gonna keep putting lotion on it, or I'm gonna go. Oh, my God, there's I'm sitting on top of a red ant nest, and we just get up and move.

385
00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:49.239
Danny Park: Oh, good! I don't. I don't need to but keep buying lotion and spend a thousand dollars a year on lotion

386
00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:52.199
Danny Park: from these bug bytes. I just have to move. I have no more bug bytes.

387
00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:57.410
Danny Park: so I no longer have bug buys, and I could stop spending money

388
00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:01.260
Danny Park: on a remedy to a symptom.

389
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:14.680
Danny Park: How many companies literally do that? They don't understand who the competitors are. The competitors are flexing their muscles in the, in, in the industry, and they keep responding to what the competitors doing, because they just didn't understand that the person that they're they're fighting

390
00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:17.790
Danny Park: or they're they see in the market is actually their competitor.

391
00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:30.599
Danny Park: right? So have to run the analysis to figure out what the actual business problem is. So you have all these benchmarking

392
00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:32.309
Danny Park: process analysis.

393
00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:43.670
Danny Park: So everything you see in the business, an analysis tool set is is meant to provide the business analytic team discoveries

394
00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:53.639
Danny Park: to determine what the actual business problem is, and also at the same time to bolster the data set because you're going to have discoveries made that you're like, you know what? That has to be in the data set.

395
00:43:56.290 --> 00:43:58.589
Danny Park: For example, if you discover a new competitor.

396
00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:04.319
Danny Park: If you go back to Competiti as examples, I go back to competitor analysis.

397
00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:05.300
Danny Park: right?

398
00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:08.489
Danny Park: We may have a competitor

399
00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:14.780
Danny Park: who's solving the same problem for customs for the same customer, but in a different way.

400
00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:20.700
Danny Park: So if you're if we're not paying attention to that, we we might lose our customer

401
00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:27.329
Danny Park: because my customer would say, oh, you know what that company is, still solving my problem, but they're doing it different than way you do. I like the way they do it

402
00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:32.959
Danny Park: right. And I go back to the blackberry

403
00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:40.109
Danny Park: right? Although the black bear and iphone

404
00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:46.190
Danny Park: right, they're attacking the same business problem, but just in a different way.

405
00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:52.640
Danny Park: and people gravitated more toward the way iphone was doing it

406
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:59.210
Danny Park: with their full setup integrations and power of the Ios system.

407
00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:12.539
Danny Park: Alright. So that's that for this

408
00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:17.430
Danny Park: slide deck, this lecture.

409
00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:23.390
Danny Park: so don't need to memorize. like all the tool sets right the analysis right?

410
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:28.070
Danny Park: We have. But we have to appreciate that if we wanted to make

411
00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:31.320
Danny Park: the best business decision.

412
00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:36.149
Danny Park: All these things that we cover in the green have to come together.

413
00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:42.200
and

414
00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:45.840
Danny Park: the Mbas who understand that more

415
00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:49.920
Danny Park: will have a deeper understanding. Or, in other words, they're literate.

416
00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:55.020
Danny Park: They are the ones who outwork and outperform other Mbas.

417
00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:06.030
Danny Park: And in essence, and the Mba is business is a is a business analyst. A CEO is is the ultimate business analyst.

418
00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:13.420
Danny Park: Alright? So that's it

419
00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:31.260
Danny Park: for our review, for the content, right? Everything. All the other content is that we we you know, the the these other topics are on the exam. One review. So please go take a look at that. So here I am, ready to ask answer any questions that anyone has.

420
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:47.490
Danny Park: But go ahead. Oh, yeah, just to confirm. So the ones highlighted in green are the only ones that will be covered on the final. Okay, so for the green, all you got, I, yeah, just look at that like, if you look, if you look at, if you review the exam, one

421
00:46:47.690 --> 00:47:00.780
Danny Park: recording that we did will go through the important parts that you need to know from the green side, so I didn't want to go through that with any like again, because, like, that's a waste of time, I don't want to keep anyone here longer than need to, because I know everyone is going to work on the group project

422
00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:14.429
Danny Park: after this. So just for those, II guess a tip would be. Go back to our example and review recording, and then just remind yourself exactly the portions in the green that I covered, and then.

423
00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:17.109
Danny Park: I guess, go through this recording

424
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:27.329
Danny Park: to get exactly what parts that I just covered. And then just think through how those things are interrelated, because there is a connection

425
00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:41.029
Danny Park: so to do well. On the final exam. the answers are going to have to interconnect multiple concepts from the greens that we see to answer the the actual problem.

426
00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:44.530
Danny Park: the questions I pose right?

427
00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:54.060
Danny Park: It's it's the same, just like trying to figure out exactly what being being asked. And then we try to find the, you know, the comprehensive specific answer to that. Yeah.

428
00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:57.209
Danny Park: right? Any other questions.

429
00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:13.940
Danny Park: Sorry. Just one other 10, yeah, is the is the data wrangling and descriptive statistics going to be on the final or no? No, no, no, okay, don't worry. Yep, no, no, no statistics

430
00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:15.070
Danny Park: on the final

431
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:23.550
Danny Park: alright. Any other any other questions.

432
00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.240
