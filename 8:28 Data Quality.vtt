00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.019
Danny Park: Hello, everybody, welcome to our

2
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.370
Danny Park: pre-recorded session on data. Quality.

3
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.650
Danny Park: So let's kind of dive right into it. I'm trying to

4
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:24.900
Danny Park: target this recording not to go over an hour and fifteen minutes. But let's see how how well I do. All right. So data quality.

5
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.639
Danny Park: So here's what's very important. So measuring data quality it's critical to understand.

6
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:51.020
Danny Park: If we want to use enterprise data confidently in both the operational and analytical applications and settings right. Only good quality data. Can power accurate or valuable, or, in other words, useful analysis, which can, you know, drive

7
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.590
Danny Park: trusted business decisions.

8
00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:05.070
Danny Park: So again, like we have to really understand what we mean by data quality. Okay. So we see the components there, and we'll kind of get into it, as you know. I I, you know, share more.

9
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:27.349
Danny Park: Ah around this topic. So, according to Gartner, right poor data card can result in additional fifteen million dollars of spend an average annual cost for an organization. Um. That annual cost can come from, you know, just four business decisions. So basically maybe you lost opportunity or you missed

10
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.190
Danny Park: compliance like you broke a rule you,

11
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:57.450
Danny Park: you know not on purpose. So you know, for those just want to clarify that. You know we we a lot in, you know literature and the media. How companies are, You know. You know they're breaking laws, and they're feeling It's comply with regulation, so it's not. It's not done on purpose. It's and it will talk to. Why, when we when we talk about data quality, it's because something was missed along the way, which is poor data management that just happened to just result in bad decisions, so that fifteen million dollars

12
00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.760
Danny Park: annual cost spend It's significant for many companies. So again, that's That's by.

13
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.520
Danny Park: Sorry I gotta go ahead. And

14
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.320
Danny Park: just for that by two hours. My apologies there. So

15
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:26.260
Danny Park: you know, a big, I guess a big example is one of the global banks about two years ago, maybe about a year and a half ago, one of their operating units in Southeast Asia got a flag for fraud

16
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:44.259
Danny Park: right? Um! And when you actually look into the background of um, how that occurred it wasn't, you know, a group of malicious executives or senior people doing fraud. It was that it was, you know, one particular player

17
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:54.089
Danny Park: didn't really understand the rules, the compliance rules and the regulations that the that the fed had, and that activity. Just wasn't caught.

18
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.660
Danny Park: It's time

19
00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:13.080
Danny Park: it wasn't raised to the proper authorities, you know, in a proper way, and no one really knew what was going on. So basically. The reporting of that instance which comes from the data generated by the organization just was of poor quality. So what ended up happening was the fed cart

20
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:30.420
Danny Park: instead of the internal controls catching it ahead of time. So that global Investment bank ended up having to pay billions of dollars in fines, and the fed actually came in and made them re-engineer. The entire internal audit processes

21
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:42.860
Danny Park: from not only the manual processes and operating procedures, but also build new technology. So it was an additional sten that that bank had to do because of that poor quality data.

22
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.190
Danny Park: So let's before we talk about data quality.

23
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:57.110
Danny Park: Right? Let's kind of talk about the three big Vs of data because we have to. You kind of have to frame it up into what big data

24
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:13.990
Danny Park: um at a high level really means to an organization, and why data quality is then important to layer on top of the three beams of of the big data. So there's three V's. Is volume, velocity and

25
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.880
Danny Park: variety.

26
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.679
Danny Park: So let's talk about variety first, so

27
00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.779
Danny Park: that's talking about the different.

28
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.810
Danny Park: The type and kinds of data that you get

29
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:34.359
Danny Park: right. It could be, you know, from structured and unstructured. So example of a structured type data is,

30
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.059
Danny Park: and I like That's it in voice

31
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:53.700
Danny Park: right invoice and buildings usually have their very well structured right, even though there might be different types of date of, you know, invoices coming in, depending on who the who the vendor is. It's still structured right, you know. There's a you know name of the company who serviced.

32
00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:15.359
Danny Park: I'll provide the service. The name of the company who purchased the service. You know, then, all the services that that were provided, you know, along with each cost. And then you know, of course. Then at the end you have a total sum due. Then the taxes apply, then total right due to the to the vendor. Um, it's. It's

33
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:23.650
Danny Park: anyone reading it can understand what it's. You know both the context and the purpose around that file. Right? So that's the example of a structured data

34
00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:38.149
Danny Park: format unstructured is something that is just all over the place that a a person, or especially a machine, when they come across this type of format in an unstructured format.

35
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:56.459
Danny Park: You kind of don't know what it's talking about, because, like it, it can be all over the place like the best example would be um text message right. Um, you know tweets are huge right? A reason why they kind of you know our politics and and politicians kind of really like, you know, like they kind of jump on tweets because one

36
00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:25.789
Danny Park: tweeds are not structured. In fact, they they kind of limit you amount of characters, so it's kind of forces it on structured nature. So if you were to read one tweet, you're you're not going to capture the whole context of what's being on. You know what's being um communicated. So you might jump to conclusion. Uh, Besides, Twitter and another will be just this, you know text right when you, when you text back a port of people, you know we're we're not using correct grammar we're using, you know, jargon or or slang, or even

37
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.020
emojis.

38
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:40.089
Danny Park: Right? So unless we understand what the topic and the background and the visuals involved, and what they how they use certain emojis or other. You know acronyms, things like that. We have no idea

39
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:55.370
Danny Park: the purpose or value of the communication happening. So that's an example of unstructured. Another type is, you know, images, videos, right images, and videos are, you know they're not text. They. It's a whole, not another type of data that comes in.

40
00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:02.450
Danny Park: You know pictures. Instagram is an example. You have videos, you know iphone videos like

41
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:09.750
Danny Park: that closed circuit camera videos, If you're in law enforcement like it's it's all you know. Again, it's it's

42
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.630
Danny Park: not only

43
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.560
Danny Park: it's like the device itself

44
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:31.280
Danny Park: leads to a different type of image and video format, right? So we So when we talk about the different types of of data files, right, We have to also understand that they're actual like, you know, Dot

45
00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:52.689
Danny Park: Png, that Jpd: all different types that are meant to, you know, consuming by one to the machines versus another, so about to keep that in mind. So we have images and videos. Next is humid, generated right? We only talked about texts right usually when human generated. Um. Unless the person has a reason to structure the message

46
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.599
Danny Park: right, it usually comes in an unstructured format

47
00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:15.890
Danny Park: right? So he does a human, generated type of data. And then there is machine generated right? You know again, those buildings that you see on that reference I referenced earlier. That's actually from machines like sat, or some other like salesforce, or some other machine, or a platform or a program that a human types, the data in

48
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:22.629
Danny Park: to, you know already, provided structured fields, and it's going to produce for you a structured data

49
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.959
Danny Park: right? They usually other machines can read. So

50
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:46.090
Danny Park: that's one of the view. So keep so keep that in mind. Not that everything that I just shared now started thinking about it around like the six components We're kind of dig deep into the six components of data. Call that, you see here the completeness, consistency, confirmity, accuracy, integrity, and timeliness.

51
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:59.890
Danny Park: Um, keep that in mind, as you know, we're talking to the the these right? So we covered the first V. Now let's go to velocity. So the velocity is how much data that you're receiving at any particular time.

52
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:19.099
Danny Park: Right? So um, not only receiving the data, but when you receive the data, what do you do with it Like you hopefully have the infrastructure to process it right? Not only, you know, not only process the data, So by processing it could be data transformation. You know, data cleansing

53
00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:21.890
Danny Park: data, loading.

54
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:41.130
Danny Park: Are there calculations that you embed? So you have to have the infrastructure ready to receive the data and start. You know what you what you need to do with the data to get it somewhat. Ah usable value, right? Then. It's going to get sent downstream into other applications for them to consume. So velocities are very important. So think about like you're getting a lot of data.

55
00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:43.219
Danny Park: How do you control for data quality?

56
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:44.810
Danny Park: Okay? So

57
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:59.579
Danny Park: when you're getting the data or generating data. Right? Like. Is it in real time? Right? It will be, you know, my example of a real time data stream would be my security. I. You know I use my home. I use

58
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:08.330
Danny Park: a security vendor right. I have cameras that I sit around my property and my front doing back door, and some of the windows right,

59
00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.450
Danny Park: and,

60
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:12.599
Danny Park: like I needed to be running twenty, four over seven.

61
00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:27.059
Danny Park: I need to know who's at the front door? Who's trying to climb over the back, and not that it happened. But you know it just I need I It It gives me, you know. It gives me that sense of of um, you know, comfort, but it needs to be continuously running,

62
00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:38.299
Danny Park: because if if I miss an event, or let's say someone actually broke into my home. But I wasn't generating that data in real time. I might have lost the opportunity to catch that bandit

63
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:54.730
Danny Park: right and then ensure home insurance because they give me a lower rate because I have security devices. If my security devices were not running in real time, they might have issue and paying out meaning, they might think. Oh, maybe I turned it off, and i'm trying to do some insurance for

64
00:10:54.870 --> 00:11:11.779
Danny Park: so real time. Data generation is also important thing to understand? Because, again, data quality is is the goal right? So the real time data generated in real time acquired in real time. Like, when do I get the data kind of thing. Then we have online and offline data,

65
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:23.319
Danny Park: Right? Ah, we know we all know what that is. So i'm not gonna, you know. Go to the basic online data is when you're connected to the Internet. That's the only time you get to that data is when you're on the Internet

66
00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:31.510
Danny Park: versus there's some files that are offline that are resigning on your laptop, and unless you share it on a

67
00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:49.099
Danny Park: a mechanism, unless you share it on a mechanism or infrastructure to actually provide your content to online consumers. You know that data is only useful to you, right? So that might impact the data quality. One of the six components, right? And then, you know, just like

68
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:56.750
Danny Park: kind of related to the real-time data generation, You know, streaming you know batching and bits, you know, basically, you know, just

69
00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:01.800
Danny Park: all the you know networking

70
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:30.809
Danny Park: Ah, discipline around, like, you know, transferring bytes to bits and packages and routers and all that stuff like that matters right if you have poor infrastructure, and you're always, you know, throttle a bottleneck for sending images or or text or files, or whatever you need to, to to your ultimate consumer. Um, that's going to impact the other part. So, velocity every organization has to understand what the velocity of data that's coming into their organization is

71
00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.970
Danny Park: in all different types,

72
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:45.589
Danny Park: right, both structured, unstructured online images, videos, human-generated machine-generated like the organization, has to have a good understanding of the velocity of the data coming in and going out.

73
00:12:47.030 --> 00:13:01.990
Danny Park: Okay, And then the third V. So you know, we we kind of start to understand that you know, everything's kind of has to be working together, right? So velocity, priority. And then we have volume. Right. Volume is just the total complete amount of data that's being generated

74
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:11.109
Danny Park: from all of your different transactions from all of the data types of file types that you have, and how fast you're getting it.

75
00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:18.550
Danny Park: So volume is, Do you have the storage space needed to collect data?

76
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:27.529
Danny Park: Try to be able to find the useful data, So you can go ahead and ensure data quality, because if you keep too much data and

77
00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.950
Danny Park: it'll cost a lot of money and time

78
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:40.180
Danny Park: the data you have to find the actual useful amounts of data, or if you're not doing any of that exercise, and you're just,

79
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:53.220
Danny Park: you know, using all the data that you have without checking for it's six components, and you have four data qualities. So remember, So again, volume, velocity, variety. They all are together

80
00:13:54.910 --> 00:14:02.399
Danny Park: has to be assessed by the organization, and they have to come to an understanding of what the organization's volume velocity of already looks like

81
00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:06.220
Danny Park: right to have a good data plan, a data management plan,

82
00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:08.289
Danny Park: All right. So

83
00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.540
Danny Park: going from the three V's:

84
00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.269
Danny Park: Now let's start to talk about

85
00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:17.590
Danny Park: the data quality dimensions.

86
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:28.259
Danny Park: Okay. So data quality dimensions are measured attributes of data which you can individually assess, interpret, and improve right. What we mean by that is,

87
00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:32.879
Danny Park: let's say you take a dataset

88
00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:35.339
Danny Park: for me a total volume of data.

89
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.839
Danny Park: You grab the real-time generated

90
00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.799
Danny Park: all lines, videos.

91
00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.339
Danny Park: And you're pulling those out.

92
00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:52.120
Danny Park: Then that's your let's say that's your data set. You want to work with right

93
00:14:52.970 --> 00:15:01.489
Danny Park: for that given data set, you could actually assess it on each of the six components. So you could ask yourself, Is this complete

94
00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:12.209
Danny Park: right example? Good example is, if I provide my streaming data to the police and my insurance company, my Home Assurance Company, and they see A.

95
00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:19.730
Danny Park: Let's say the video was running, you know twelve A. M. And at one thirty A. M. It went out the

96
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:24.089
Danny Park: from one thirty Am. To one thirty-five am. And then it started again.

97
00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.689
Danny Park: Right. So I have a five minute.

98
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:26.560
Danny Park: Yeah,

99
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:33.339
Danny Park: My my data set right. My video stream right? The data I provided. So it's not complete.

100
00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:46.730
Danny Park: Right? So then, when we go to consistency, right? We could also measure that. So i'll use. I'll use these two examples, and i'll kind of keep going in the lecture. So let's say consistency. So an insurance company might. As Hey,

101
00:15:46.950 --> 00:16:06.280
Danny Park: does that happen? A lot? Is there always a a missing timestamp between um one thirty and one thirty-five, am. Because if my recording device are always being shut off at that time every day, and that's consistent. So my data set is consistent in that gap.

102
00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:16.859
Danny Park: Then I could have a case. The insurance company that look, I didn't shut it off malicious. I wasn't in cahoots of the person who broke into my house,

103
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.900
Danny Park: because this is always going out every day.

104
00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:27.590
Danny Park: But then their argument might be well, maybe because you knew it went out every day

105
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:33.559
Danny Park: that time, because you didn't report it. Maybe you were still in. So you see how like

106
00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:41.830
Danny Park: conversation about data quality is very important, because if my data was already covering completeness and consistency,

107
00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:53.640
Danny Park: just a dialogue around the business decision. It gets easier, because right now it's difficult right that I'm engaging with my insurance company to go to make to get to a business decision.

108
00:16:54.330 --> 00:17:00.709
Danny Park: Right? Are they going to pay me out or not? Or how far do they need to do the investigation to collect more data. Now,

109
00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:06.290
Danny Park: to confirm. You know what I'm trying to say or communicate to them right. So

110
00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:20.070
Danny Park: we already. So that's a good example of a quick example of how, if your data, if your data set is missing one of the components of data quality, it could increase the amount of time and effort

111
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:37.999
Danny Park: Right? That might be unnecessary, leading to more. You know this loss of opportunity for me. For example, i'm losing out on the pay right, the the the payout um, and other things like, say, in a real business female. We we talked about how Gartner said. Fifteen million on average,

112
00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:46.840
Danny Park: is is cost to a company because of poor data quality for larger organizations, more than fifteen million. Remember, fifty million is average

113
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:57.269
Danny Park: right? Go um the um. The other example I gave of the investment bank. They lost the billions of dollars. Right?

114
00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:11.430
Danny Park: Let's talk about completeness right? Because we kind of covered it. So completeness is, is,

115
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.289
Danny Park: Does your dataset

116
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:20.579
Danny Park: have all of the attributes

117
00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.879
Danny Park: that you need

118
00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.569
Danny Park: to be able to make

119
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:28.729
Danny Park: the best business decision?

120
00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:35.790
Danny Park: Right? So that's that's That's high level in a nutshell. What completeness means

121
00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:41.069
Danny Park: a lot of

122
00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:54.239
Danny Park: I would say teams, data teams that you know my perspective, you know, in my I experience, and you know some also in like. When you read, You know literature and all the other reports, that

123
00:18:54.670 --> 00:19:04.969
Danny Park: completeness is a very big deal, but not enough Teams are ensuring or coming to an understanding. If the data is that they're using is complete or not

124
00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.270
Danny Park: right. Sometimes

125
00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:12.369
Danny Park: data sets are missing. A key variable which causes

126
00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:20.260
Danny Park: teams to provide, you know not not the most accurate or useful reporting.

127
00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:29.059
Danny Park: So again, completeness is, Do you have all of the attributes within the data set that you need to be able to arrive

128
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:33.270
Danny Park: the best business decision possible.

129
00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.810
Danny Park: So, in other words, if you're a data analyst, can you provide

130
00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:40.709
Danny Park: the best analytics

131
00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:45.040
Danny Park: to your

132
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:56.570
Danny Park: You know, a business leader or a man, or whoever you're sending it to. Because if the data is not complete, your analysis or analytics, or whatever you're providing as a deliverable might be incorrect,

133
00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:58.699
Danny Park: right, or misleading.

134
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:02.700
Danny Park: All right. So the next

135
00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:11.940
Danny Park: dimension of quality of data quality. Let's talk about accuracy right, because accuracy is the

136
00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:16.309
Danny Park: There's another thing that's you know. Obviously it's important. But

137
00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:31.060
Danny Park: i'm not talking about accuracy when it comes to like calculations right like two plus two equals four. That's easy accuracy, meaning. If you get a set of raw data with all of its attributes, how do you know what you received is accurate,

138
00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:49.040
Danny Park: right? So data accuracy is a level to which data represents the real world scenario and confirms with a verifiable source right So accuracy of data ensures that the associated real-world entities can participate as plan.

139
00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:53.799
Danny Park: Right? So another way to kind of, say, this is

140
00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.399
Danny Park: when a business transaction occurs,

141
00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:07.380
Danny Park: that business transaction must be documented within the data.

142
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:12.660
Danny Park: So when you see, let's say a list of transactions,

143
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:20.640
Danny Park: you know it's going to have this to use the building example. It's going to have the vendor. It's going to have the the

144
00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.520
Danny Park: the

145
00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:31.389
Danny Park: person who receives the services. What was, you know, what service was delivered, and

146
00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:36.569
Danny Park: you know, and the bill like you know, the rate per hour and the final bill, the

147
00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:40.070
Danny Park: and you get You get a whole list of those

148
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:58.369
Danny Park: before we can move on to our additional analysis of that data. If i'm a business analyst and doing business analytics on on my, on my data set that I was provided to list of transactions. Right I have to. I I'm. I'm going to assume that these things are accurate

149
00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.620
Danny Park: right that what i'm being provided

150
00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:04.579
Danny Park: so, How do I that know that's act? It's accurate right

151
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:06.709
Danny Park: that comes from

152
00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.110
Danny Park: You know this confirmity.

153
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:14.989
Danny Park: There has to be something in that data set file that gives me some comfort

154
00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.029
Danny Park: that it's either confirmed or

155
00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.600
Danny Park: or

156
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:36.659
Danny Park: I have a way to go ahead and track it down and trace it back to get the confirmation that the transaction, or that that set of data that i'm analyzing would actually occur. So meaning that business scenario actually occurred. So what

157
00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:43.880
Danny Park: what do you know usual files usually have, Right? They, you know. Let's say, if we use tag example, they use our social security number

158
00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.860
Danny Park: right for individual taxes,

159
00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.930
Danny Park: right? They'll you know, they basically, say, Hey,

160
00:22:48.940 --> 00:23:07.099
Danny Park: you know what's your name? What your address? What's your source? Screen number? What's the E. I. N. Of your employer and all those things. So since they're giving you a paper trail or a set of data that helps you confirm the accuracy of things, it's helpful for us

161
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:10.620
Danny Park: to just really use it like work with the data,

162
00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:14.469
Danny Park: right? And as we're going through the file,

163
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:25.569
Danny Park: you know, if you see some, you know some things that we have. We have a question around, or it looks a little fuzzy to us, but you can go in and go back and confirm it.

164
00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:35.500
Danny Park: This is the the the confirmity, accuracy really kind of going in hand hand. So usually when when I see data sets, and

165
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.270
Danny Park: if I don't see any data

166
00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:42.160
Danny Park: that kind of shows

167
00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.310
Danny Park: it was confirmed,

168
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.540
Danny Park: or

169
00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:59.859
Danny Park: provides me an ability to get confirmation. Then I have to kind of lean toward the the assumption that the data set might not be as accurate as I need it to be to be able to do my analysis.

170
00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:10.079
Danny Park: Okay, So i'm not saying we need one hundred percent accuracy in our data sets, because to get to one hundred percent accuracy accuracy. Sometimes the the return on investment is not there

171
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:15.989
Danny Park: right If it's going to cost me a a a, you know. Let's say, half a million dollars.

172
00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:18.550
Danny Park: Go ahead and and

173
00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:23.939
Danny Park: confirm each line of my row. But the purpose of the data set

174
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:36.899
Danny Park: to analyze it is to in the hopes of driving, driving two hundred thousand dollars in revenue. Obviously, why would I spend five hundred thousand dollars in spend just to drive two hundred thousand dollars in revenue.

175
00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:43.319
Danny Park: Right? I'm. Already at a loss there. So you have to do some return and investment analysis around the

176
00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:59.480
Danny Park: the accuracy. So as good business analytics, leaders or business analytics, business analysts. The first thing we should look in a dataset is, you know if obviously a way to kind of trace, and then confirm the accuracy of the data set, or

177
00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:10.470
Danny Park: something that shows that it was already confirmed. Like, for example, for anyone working in audit if you were, you know, if you work in internal art and external audit, you know the systems that you use

178
00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:22.260
Danny Park: provide date in time stamps of when it was reviewed and signed off, so a sign of means that someone reviewed it for its accuracy, and can speak to the accuracy of the dataset.

179
00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:25.690
Danny Park: Okay, So

180
00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:27.140
Danny Park: most

181
00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.759
Danny Park: data sets and large organizations

182
00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:39.679
Danny Park: that are being worked on. They always have some timestamp book or a confirmative for those who are working today.

183
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:42.510
You're working in a set of data.

184
00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:51.560
Danny Park: If there is no confirmation that your data is accurate, you really shouldn't assume that your data is accurate enough to work on.

185
00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:53.800
Danny Park: Okay, Um.

186
00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:09.020
Danny Park: So if there any questions around that, of course, please feel free to email me, i'll touch upon, you know i'll again. I'll address any questions that that we have when we meet live. But it's an important concept to understand, like

187
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:12.890
Danny Park: what the problem I see is when I see

188
00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:19.480
Danny Park: especially I'm more on the junior side when junior analysts come in and they're analyzing a data set.

189
00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:31.989
Danny Park: They're not. They're too quick to start to start doing their their You know their the calculations, the process like they're not really going back to going back into the data set to see if it's already been signed up for confirm.

190
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:40.330
Danny Park: They could be like a simple email like you get an email saying, Hey, the data, the data set attaches email. They all been confirmed by this group. I'll be a good to go.

191
00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:50.409
Danny Park: So where we run a lot of issues with confirmation of data sets is actually around, you know. Open source, right?

192
00:26:50.620 --> 00:27:09.100
Danny Park: You know. People go to open source. They they're pulling down files and datasets and calculations that say templates right here in lean Sigma world like. So i'll just share an example in lean six, Sigma. There's a there's a heavy. There's a list of heavy, heavy calculations that you do at the platform level. Um!

193
00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:25.589
Danny Park: So I know of one ah process excellence consultant who actually went on an open-source site and and pulled down a so leading six, Sigma like Count Template. We just punch in the numbers, and it'll give you the calculations that we need for um,

194
00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:31.819
Danny Park: for our continuous improvements, our plans and approaches that we want to implement.

195
00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:41.260
Danny Park: So this you know, this consultant was just using it and plugging numbers and giving all that. You know all that stuff to the client. And when the client was

196
00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:47.970
Danny Park: obviously to have a review phase when they're reviewing, when they're at least sixteen by people reviewing the numbers and calculations, something was off.

197
00:27:49.540 --> 00:28:03.979
Danny Park: So then they asked to the consultant they said, Hey, like? You know, these numbers seem off like How did you calculate them. And then he said, Oh, I use this template. So when they dug into the the template and the formulas, all the formulas were wrong

198
00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.270
Danny Park: that led to, you know, some issues, but

199
00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:13.180
Danny Park: to that consultant's fault that consultant assumed accuracy

200
00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:17.700
Danny Park: a template that you really couldn't confirm

201
00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:36.460
Danny Park: if that template was like you know. Useful, right? It didn't know it's open source. You don't know who created it. It was posting some random website or user board, and and and you just download it and started using it right. Nothing in the file said it was reviewed or signed off, and it again Didn't give, you, you know, going back like source

202
00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:43.359
Danny Park: right to trace back to how it was creating and who created it. So that's the example of,

203
00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:49.130
Danny Park: you know, really on the you know a data analyst or a business analyst

204
00:28:50.440 --> 00:29:09.889
Danny Park: really assuming incorrectly and causing a lot of problems downstream, because what happens is what what happened. Both teams, both the consulting team and the client team had to bring in a wrangle to gather the data that was created to bring up the data quality higher, so that they had to really redo all the numbers and processes to get.

205
00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.460
Danny Park: It is accurate

206
00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:14.260
Danny Park: right by using the accurate formulas

207
00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:17.510
Danny Park: all right,

208
00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:22.030
Danny Park: So moving on next would be consistency,

209
00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:37.449
Danny Park: all right, so kind of touch upon consistency, using my insurance example. So this dimension, this dimension, represents, if the same information stored and used, and multiple instances, matches

210
00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:45.850
Danny Park: right? So what do you mean by that? It means that so? I use it like a Ted example, or you know the tax industry.

211
00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.489
Danny Park: So in in the tax industry

212
00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:54.520
Danny Park: for anyone who's working in the Big Four, and you're in tax. You probably see this every day. You know where i'm going to go with it.

213
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:55.680
Danny Park: So

214
00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:59.730
Danny Park: in tax the Pwc. Tax team

215
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:17.380
Danny Park: they get their data from several different, so they get it from one client. Let's say, you know you are a tax engagement team, right? And you're working with. Let's call client client One client. One needs to give you their financial data for you to go ahead and start

216
00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:36.190
Danny Park: doing the tax work, the tax prep and the tax work to go ahead and file client, one's tax, so client one needs to give you its data client one. And this is for real like I'm not kidding client. One gets their financial data from several different third parties, right? Because client one

217
00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:43.780
Danny Park: at the global level. Because, you know, Pwc works with global clients. They're in several different types of businesses,

218
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:51.259
Danny Park: Those businesses, those third parties use several different types of data systems to generate their data.

219
00:30:51.550 --> 00:31:02.830
Danny Park: So when all you know, so the client one, I guess i'll use a for example, client one. It was a real client. They had thirty, seven different

220
00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:13.639
Danny Park: sources of their data, so they're getting it from thirty, seven different third parties, and it was client. One was getting it and client one was taking it and then giving it to

221
00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:15.960
Danny Park: the ped overseas tax engagement team.

222
00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.130
Danny Park: The problem with that is

223
00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:24.460
Danny Park: client One right, Let's say, client one that lets it. But client one has a number of investors.

224
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:28.909
Danny Park: So let's call investor. Um.

225
00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.490
Danny Park: Let's call an investor, Peter right, Peter. So,

226
00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:36.389
Danny Park: Peter Peter, you know what I've been watching game of thrones

227
00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:48.960
Danny Park: with House of Dragons, but i'm a Peter Thinklage right. It's a Peter Dinklage, not the real one. I just made it up like I don't know if Peter, if he does key to ding with his taxes or not, I have no idea. I just I just he's my favorite actor.

228
00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:53.860
Danny Park: So Peter Dinklage is an investor in client one.

229
00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:57.080
Danny Park: So since this is investing in client, one

230
00:31:57.610 --> 00:32:03.079
Danny Park: he's going to get financial data that relates to him from several different

231
00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:13.449
Danny Park: um, all the third parties, right? So all the third parties put in their financial data, and all the data that comes into Peter is It's it's. You know it's under Peter's profile.

232
00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.330
Danny Park: Let's take one.

233
00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:25.170
Danny Park: Um. Let's say, let's take one revenue type. Right. Let's say um

234
00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:28.090
Danny Park: uh dividends right?

235
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.450
Danny Park: Peter Thinklidge gets his dividends.

236
00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:54.789
Danny Park: That originates from the third party, and it's called dividend. So a three hundred dollars dividend right, and it's under Peter's profile. Right? So that's a category in Peter's profile view. Imagine a a spreadsheet with Peter's, you know profile, and one of the columns has no other rows as

237
00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.290
Danny Park: David and income.

238
00:32:56.950 --> 00:33:03.200
Danny Park: Right so then, let's say, another vendor comes in, and it's dividend income.

239
00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:11.549
Danny Park: It's from dividends, and it's income it's going to Peter, but this company calls dividend income. They call that passive income

240
00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:20.940
Danny Park: right? But it's the same thing. It's dividend income from one company what they? It's it's it. But this company happens to call dividend in compassive income.

241
00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:24.760
Danny Park: So then, that's a second row,

242
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:29.679
Danny Park: right, and Peter's profile. So we have dividend income and passive income. The

243
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:38.739
Danny Park: So let's say that happens. It keeps happening, and there is there, out of the thirty-seven companies. Twenty of them are calling David and income something different.

244
00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:41.170
Danny Park: So that's inconsistent.

245
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:46.259
Danny Park: So if you want to calculate Peter's total dividend income

246
00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:50.189
Danny Park: right that he needs to pay a lower tax rate on

247
00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:57.609
Danny Park: How would we calculate that in the actual dat sheet, when all of them are labeled something different,

248
00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:02.129
Danny Park: right? We would have to either do some data transformation,

249
00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:09.229
Danny Park: name them all the same. So we could actually do the sum by the sum. The some formula

250
00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:18.319
Danny Park: like, or made it data tag, or do something, I don't know, but the point is because it's because it's not consistent. Used

251
00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:26.930
Danny Park: right. It's not consistent. If the income passive income, you know whatever other income there they could be.

252
00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:31.230
Danny Park: It's caused a lot of data quality issues, because what if

253
00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:36.589
Danny Park: there's there's an income passive income and some other company calls it Um,

254
00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:41.209
Danny Park: non, uh you know non-active income,

255
00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:58.089
Danny Park: right? Which really what they mean in tasks. But as a tax professional who's young who just started in tax. This Never been on this climb before it is the first time, seeing that they might say, Oh, not an active income. I never seen that that, I guess I don't think that's dividends or passive income,

256
00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:04.960
Danny Park: although it is because it's the inconsistency of it, like the tax professional doesn't. Add that

257
00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:12.649
Danny Park: her his total calculation of the of the income for for Peter, and add the

258
00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:18.370
Danny Park: the non-active income to some other income category which is taxed higher. The

259
00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:20.970
Danny Park: So, because of that

260
00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:26.819
Danny Park: that error right. Peter might end up paying more text that he needs to

261
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:32.150
Danny Park: right. So that's the issue around data, a consistency

262
00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:36.640
Danny Park: that is pervasive right now in

263
00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:38.229
Danny Park: the industry.

264
00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:44.479
Danny Park: Right. So consistency is very important. Again, consistency basically means that

265
00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:46.770
Danny Park: dividend income

266
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.229
Danny Park: should be dividend income

267
00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:51.410
Danny Park: by all thirty-seven.

268
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:55.020
Danny Park: Third-party vendors was given their data.

269
00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:02.699
Danny Park: It's not. We have inconsistent data, and since it's inconsistent, it's,

270
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:08.939
Danny Park: the analyst has to find a way to create consistency in that data.

271
00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:17.259
Danny Park: The the the further away a data set is from consistency, the increase in

272
00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:19.689
Danny Park: error rate

273
00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:25.439
Danny Park: right? And that's again. I'll just kind of go to like, you know.

274
00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:28.829
Danny Park: You know, just my first kind of

275
00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:36.520
Danny Park: sharing of a lot of the paintings I see in in junior level resources that because you know it's

276
00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:48.280
Danny Park: they again, like, I said, they start too early, and in trying to analyze. And i'm not analyzed and doing the actual processing calculations

277
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:55.310
Danny Park: Right? There's no they don't like a good, a well, a really good. This analyst

278
00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:09.420
Danny Park: is looking at the data set, and also checking, not only for completeness and accuracy through through through through confirmation, but also to see if consistency is lacking

279
00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:12.990
Danny Park: in that example, that simple task, example,

280
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:21.840
Danny Park: right. Where we have dividend income, passive income and not active income, it's very easy to assume something's consistent.

281
00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.809
Danny Park: But when it's not

282
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:29.649
Danny Park: all right. So

283
00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:37.569
Danny Park: that's very important to keep an eye on. So after consistency,

284
00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:51.279
Danny Park: let's talk about timeliness. So what is timeliness. Timeliness is Basically, saying, Are you getting the right data at the right time and getting it to the right? People who are going to make the business decisions

285
00:37:52.210 --> 00:38:11.820
Danny Park: right? So timeliness that just doesn't mean that you get the data on time, and that's another. I guess that's the issue that I see again with. I mean our business analysts and data analysts who just, you know, who are entry level right? Because, again, it's all the subject kind of like over experience, and when you have a good coach and good mentor and good training is,

286
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:19.299
Danny Park: they never ask about when the data needs to be sent to the business teams.

287
00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:26.029
Danny Park: They view timeliness as only one fact or meaning, you know. Did they get it

288
00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:33.650
Danny Park: right? That good? They get it on time right? So they could do their work, but they don't. They never really ask about. Hey you?

289
00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:39.030
Danny Park: I wait on this, and I process this late.

290
00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:44.249
Danny Park: I don't process this in the time that the business leaders are requiring of me,

291
00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:47.529
Danny Park: right? Maybe when I send the analysis

292
00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:54.849
Danny Park: that raw data that I needed was actually up, and that the raw data that actually used to do my analysis. The

293
00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:58.040
Danny Park: was actually updated thirty minutes ago,

294
00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:13.640
Danny Park: right? Because I just you know, I just took that long. And let's say, you know, Data came at nine nine Am. And I analyzed it at three Pm. And then I sent it off to the business leaders to for them to help them make their business decision.

295
00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:17.060
Danny Park: But between nine Am. To three Pm.

296
00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:21.489
Danny Park: At let's say ten, thirty, A. M. That raw data that I used

297
00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:26.170
Danny Park: was updated. So my analysis was using outdated data.

298
00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:37.399
Danny Park: So then, when they get to the business leaders, they're going to assume they might assume that the analysis that I did was using the most recent data, which was at ten, thirty, but actually using a nine Am. B.

299
00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:39.520
Danny Park: That happens all the time

300
00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:42.409
Danny Park: all the time.

301
00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:51.309
Danny Park: Right? So timeliness is in it's. It's. It's an exercise that the business and data analyst has to do.

302
00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:54.109
Danny Park: Ah!

303
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:58.190
Danny Park: By including all the stakeholders, not just themselves.

304
00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:02.120
Danny Park: Greatest

305
00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.279
Danny Park: untimely data

306
00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:07.259
Danny Park: automatically

307
00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:12.859
Danny Park: renders that data analysis inaccurate.

308
00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:26.199
Danny Park: Right? So it's a good thing to understand as a data and business analyst to what and the the stakeholders need to report. Then also check with the database administrators, or whoever is giving them the data

309
00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:29.210
Danny Park: when the refreshes of the data happen.

310
00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:32.310
Danny Park: So the analysis

311
00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:38.759
Danny Park: being done on that data is using the most at number most recent,

312
00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:42.439
Danny Park: confirmed an accurate data possible.

313
00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:48.990
Danny Park: All right. In the last. One

314
00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:52.240
Danny Park: kind of relates to

315
00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:56.240
Danny Park: the source of data, writes called data integrity.

316
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:58.109
Danny Park: So

317
00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:15.860
Danny Park: you know, when data enters the organization right that you know you acquire data, the data is usually transformed multiple times across multiple systems before it actually gets to the analyst, Right? Usually the analyst

318
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:17.250
Danny Park: Um:

319
00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:22.859
Danny Park: Yeah, The analysts most often gets the data at the end

320
00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:38.459
Danny Park: right? Because it's, you know, like you know, if you think about um like this tax data, you know. Let's use a tax an example like at Pwc tax teams. When they get the data, they usually the last person, the last team or person or individual to do the process,

321
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:53.830
Danny Park: because after that it's going off to the tax authority because you're fine, but you're filing um taxes for your client. So from a getting to a P. Of C tax engagement team That data went through.

322
00:41:54.060 --> 00:42:02.759
Danny Park: You know all the banks, all the private equity firms, all the auditors and all their systems and all of their

323
00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:07.560
Danny Park: transaction did like everything. It goes to everything across everything right. So

324
00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:11.669
Danny Park: because data, the data's journeying, the

325
00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.939
Danny Park: yes,

326
00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:15.950
Danny Park: very complex,

327
00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:19.949
Danny Park: and across several different systems and ecosystems,

328
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:24.490
Danny Park: we have to ask,

329
00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:27.800
Danny Park: What's the integrity of the data?

330
00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:42.600
Danny Park: Right? So integrity indicates that the attributes are maintained correctly, even as data gets stored and used in diverse systems data integrity ensures that all enterprise data can be traced and connected.

331
00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:50.620
Danny Park: Right? So I guess What's What's a good example of data losing its integrity?

332
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:51.439
Okay,

333
00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:54.330
Danny Park: um hacking.

334
00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:58.230
Danny Park: So let's say there's someone in your company

335
00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:00.370
Danny Park: Cool

336
00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:03.980
Danny Park: Wants to know. Steal money.

337
00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:12.590
Danny Park: I'll give you actually a real example. This is really cool, like a really cool but tragic example. So this back when I was in Marine Corps.

338
00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:13.569
Danny Park: Um!

339
00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:17.399
Danny Park: So there was a kernel in my battalion

340
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:21.789
Danny Park: uh who was looking at his paycheck,

341
00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:32.350
Danny Park: and he found it odd. This guy was like a super nerd, this guy He had to be a narrative of the catch. This he found that that every other paycheck

342
00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:35.330
Danny Park: it was off by five cents

343
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:40.449
Danny Park: right meaning, because in the military, in the government, like you get paid like

344
00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:41.639
Danny Park: down to that

345
00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:50.029
Danny Park: Any like pay like it doesn't change right? So you kind of know every every page the exact amount you're getting

346
00:43:50.040 --> 00:44:00.979
Danny Park: So he was like, Why Is it like every other, you know, to pay pay payday? Whatever like it's, It's five cents less right than previous,

347
00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:15.499
Danny Park: and he was like asking around. And then, you know, like some of the other, you know, like not some like all the marines, the battalion was saying, Oh, yeah, yeah, Oh, yeah. I noticed that, like I like. I just noticed that I had no idea.

348
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:26.669
Danny Park: And then they started to kind of go back into their pay right to pay stuff to see how long it has been happening, and it was like, you know, up to. I think some were up to five years, and that this was happening.

349
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:34.489
Danny Park: So now a a full investigation was done, and it coming to find out that there was a marine who's working in Admin.

350
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:39.289
Danny Park: Who was diverting five cents

351
00:44:39.730 --> 00:44:46.109
Danny Park: every the time. Every marine, the battalion five cents from every paycheck, the

352
00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:50.479
Danny Park: right, every other, every other paycheck, into his personal account

353
00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:56.969
Danny Park: right over the last, like five years right, and he thought that

354
00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:59.490
Danny Park: no one would notice, because it's only five cents.

355
00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:18.209
Danny Park: Well, he ran, and he ran to the right. He ran to that one colonel. Who was it? Was that of a mega nerd um. So he got caught and he got. He went to break like I don't know how long I heard it was like for fifteen years, or something in the break for fraud, and whatever the Ucmj. So the Ucmj. Is a military military version of um

356
00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:28.290
Danny Park: of the judicial system, right? And so in the for military folks we actually fall into both jurisdictions, like, if we do something bad. First the Federal Government will come after us or the State government.

357
00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:34.600
Danny Park: Then, after we get punished for them, we get punished by the military, and the military is always.

358
00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:51.659
Danny Park: It's always the punitive side of the military is always definitely harsher than the civilian side, so like it kind of keeps, you know, military folks in line, but this marine thought he was smarter than the average bear ran to the Colonel, who was smarter than Yogi Bear, and then he went to jail.

359
00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:56.359
Danny Park: Well, eleven, one military jail, which is not a not a great place.

360
00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.660
Danny Park: That's what we mean by

361
00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:02.599
Danny Park: integrity. Failure,

362
00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:09.150
Danny Park: right? So So the database was not maintained correctly,

363
00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:26.489
Danny Park: right what the data wasn't stored correctly. Um, Because you had an outside agent who was actually manipulating the system to where it should be every month. The same pay is going out to, you know the the recipients instead

364
00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:34.439
Danny Park: portions of it. Every other payday was, you know, every other day that was being diverted. So there was no integrity in this system

365
00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:45.050
Danny Park: driven by a a bad player. So data integrity is very important. So it kind of rolls up to confirmity and also aggregate right. So

366
00:46:45.360 --> 00:47:03.780
Danny Park: because it's almost insanely impossible to to confirm integrity of massive amounts of data. That's where we have a full team on the infrastructure side that ensures data integrity. Right? You have one cybersecurity professionals who who literally block

367
00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:06.330
Danny Park: or um,

368
00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:17.610
Danny Park: you know, like literally like prevent outside external hacks coming in, and also to identify, eliminate, and prevent internal

369
00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:19.790
Danny Park: right. Um

370
00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:23.350
Danny Park: fraud and all the manipulation from happening. So

371
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:39.090
Danny Park: those two things, you know, cyber security um is the frontline defense for ensuring that everyone trusted the day that's coming out, I mean, and i'll tell you how integrity is very important. So even when you know that investment banks like I called for fraud.

372
00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:50.760
Danny Park: The Feds were not questioning the consistency confirmity, accuracy of completeness or timeliness of the data they're saying, We don't trust the integrity of your data.

373
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:58.329
Danny Park: We're going to go that far, because we just don't know that it was just one player

374
00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:08.610
Danny Park: right like Why did it? Why didn't someone notice this at the data administrative level, right? Or the cyber security level or the risk management?

375
00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:13.169
Danny Park: So integrity is a is a very big deal,

376
00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:20.070
Danny Park: and it's something that all

377
00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:22.620
Danny Park: you know Business leaders

378
00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:28.620
Danny Park: have to be aware of right when it comes to understanding how the organization

379
00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:35.189
Danny Park: acquiring its high volume of data and

380
00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:38.210
Danny Park: right meeting. Where is it coming from?

381
00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.229
Danny Park: Who is generating?

382
00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:49.880
Danny Park: What different types of data are there

383
00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:56.300
Danny Park: right? And then how fast are we getting it and generating it

384
00:48:56.460 --> 00:49:02.339
Danny Park: right? So the three V's. To have a really good direct relation to the integrity. So the plan,

385
00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:12.540
Danny Park: the data, the data, acquisition and management plan. That organization has the strategy that the organization has. It's ensuring this the integrity.

386
00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:21.929
Danny Park: Okay, So

387
00:49:22.850 --> 00:49:27.060
Danny Park: that's the you know, at the analyst level. Right?

388
00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:31.959
Danny Park: Um! What? What? What can we do

389
00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:37.129
Danny Park: to ensure data quality? And it's as easy as this is just asking questions around

390
00:49:38.330 --> 00:49:46.869
Danny Park: right? I mean, I used to tell, you know I used. I still tell my teams today, I say, hey, when you're working with the data and you get it, and then you get data from somewhere.

391
00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:50.049
Danny Park: First,

392
00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:57.729
Danny Park: you have to understand the purpose of the analyst or analysis that you're doing.

393
00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:08.210
Danny Park: If you don't, understand the value of the analysis. Right? Then you don't know how to assess your data for completeness. For example,

394
00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:11.760
Danny Park: right? If the purpose of your data is

395
00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:19.170
Danny Park: to help, the let's say the business leaders make a decision on

396
00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:21.379
Danny Park: which market

397
00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:22.979
Danny Park: tender,

398
00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:31.469
Danny Park: right? So they want to pursue a particular market that they ever pursued before. So when you go back into your data set you

399
00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:37.659
Danny Park: right. There should be data in there that's relates to. You know.

400
00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:57.840
Danny Park: You know market entry type data, right, you know, which which markets are your competitors, and who's in it? How much is what's the market should look like? Where does ped of C stand today? It's like old, so like it. It understanding the value of your data right? I mean the the purpose of your data analysis will help you back into if it's complete or not

401
00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:08.259
Danny Park: right? And then everything else going, you know, release the consistency, confirmity, accuracy, your timing timeliness, integrity, is just, you know the question

402
00:51:09.310 --> 00:51:16.850
Danny Park: right or just going to someone who's more experienced, right like your coach or mentor, and ask them, hey? I got this data that can you help me review it for completeness.

403
00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:26.699
Danny Park: Right? So. And here's the Here's a a really good metric for you for those who. Um,

404
00:51:26.770 --> 00:51:41.840
Danny Park: no. Are we interested in data, analytics and business analytics? Right? Well, it's really okay. So it's really data analytics. I know. I know business analytics is the name of the course. But business analytics is data analytics.

405
00:51:41.850 --> 00:51:52.500
Danny Park: Okay, It's like we're analyzing data for a business purpose. So we call it business analytics, but it's the same like this kind of goes hand in hand in hand. So anyone who wants to be a

406
00:51:52.930 --> 00:51:55.660
Danny Park: have build a career around data quality.

407
00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:03.160
Danny Park: What plans

408
00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:07.399
Danny Park: do we have in place

409
00:52:08.350 --> 00:52:12.089
Danny Park: to account for the three V's:

410
00:52:12.210 --> 00:52:14.349
Danny Park: how we're going to

411
00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:19.749
Danny Park: collectively take the data that we have right

412
00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:23.680
Danny Park: and ensure these six components, the

413
00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:26.390
Danny Park: So there's like a methodology and framework

414
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:32.229
Danny Park: plans in place to ensure data quality. That's data strategy work.

415
00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:50.670
Danny Park: So when you guys hear data strategy, it's as simple as oh, what you do. But what that rule means is you're trying. You're developing plans, processes, technology, implementations, methodologies, and frameworks to ensure that the the data that you get

416
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:53.410
Danny Park: whatever type it is,

417
00:52:53.940 --> 00:53:06.679
Danny Park: no matter how much data that you have, and no matter how fast you're getting and and sending data you're ensuring these components in every transaction that's occurring in your company.

418
00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:18.200
Danny Park: Okay? And so why is data strategy becoming such a huge topic? Right? I mean, I first had an example.

419
00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:19.939
Danny Park: Um,

420
00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:33.389
Danny Park: and it's not like it's not anything secret. I think every organization is trying to work toward this right now, and any big, any large organization right now is they're trying to figure out how they're going to standardize the acquisition of their data,

421
00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:39.210
Danny Park: then how to transform it and process it in a way. We're all downstream.

422
00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:45.220
Danny Park: Consumers can seamlessly integrate it into their systems or operational processes.

423
00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:47.410
Danny Park: Um:

424
00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:49.639
Danny Park: So Forbes

425
00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:57.980
Danny Park: right? Their recent survey of Ceos, Eighty four percent of Ceos are concerned about data quality,

426
00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:03.220
Danny Park: right? So

427
00:54:07.090 --> 00:54:13.330
Danny Park: with that data quality concern, right? They are focused on

428
00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:14.810
Danny Park: two areas

429
00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:18.419
Danny Park: which is the integrity of their data

430
00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:21.049
Danny Park: and the accuracy of the data.

431
00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:27.069
Danny Park: So, in other words, the word that we could, the word that they're looking for

432
00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:31.549
Danny Park: right? So what does data quality really mean?

433
00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:33.550
Danny Park: It means trust.

434
00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:38.169
Danny Park: What Ceos are asking is, can we trust

435
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:40.329
Danny Park: the data that we get

436
00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:44.169
Danny Park: our data strategy

437
00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:48.229
Danny Park: to enable us to make the best decision

438
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.729
Danny Park: to gain a competitive advantage?

439
00:54:55.890 --> 00:54:57.120
Danny Park: Thank you. So

440
00:54:57.890 --> 00:55:00.589
Danny Park: i'll kind of end our session with this,

441
00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:04.219
Danny Park: because I think we're we're getting to about an hour worth of recording.

442
00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:09.589
Danny Park: Okay, So to determine data quality, it's an ongoing task.

443
00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:19.390
Danny Park: It's, it's It's never ending. It's not. And not only at the analysts level it's at every level organization, right? It's an enterprise-wide

444
00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:27.179
Danny Park: there has to be standards in place across the entire enterprise that everyone has a a real

445
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:28.399
Danny Park: start

446
00:55:28.530 --> 00:55:29.879
Danny Park: around

447
00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:34.810
Danny Park: the quality of the data that they're using day in and day out.

448
00:55:35.550 --> 00:55:44.800
Danny Park: Okay. And and here I might be kind of. I might be kind of going overboard. But this is where I approach it, right. I even consider emails

449
00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:47.729
Danny Park: like data clog. And when I get an email from somewhere,

450
00:55:48.090 --> 00:55:49.180
Danny Park: right,

451
00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:55.899
Danny Park: I go. Okay, Did I get the information?

452
00:55:56.200 --> 00:56:15.509
Danny Park: And is the information in the email convey to me. Is it timely? Not that I got the email, like during my working hours? I'm talking about the information in that email like is this is whatever the send is trying to describe for me or sharing with me. Is that timely? When did that data?

453
00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:21.630
Danny Park: When was a data shared with that sender, because just because that sender email me at nine zero A. M. Today

454
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:28.780
Danny Park: example, right? They that data within that email that person might have got two weeks ago. So

455
00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:32.320
Danny Park: there's nothing in that

456
00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:33.669
Danny Park: email

457
00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:35.989
Danny Park: the real email. I'm: kind of referring to real email

458
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.220
Danny Park: there. There was nothing in that email

459
00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:55.689
Danny Park: that tells me what gives me a clue as to when that person got that data that person didn't say, Hey, Danny, I saw I got a data. I got this information and report from X person on y date at this time. That was basic from the email.

460
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:58.970
So I am already assuming. Okay, It's not timely.

461
00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:15.050
Danny Park: I could confirm it. Good! I'm going to go and confirm it, or ask this person to confirm it. But right now i'm not going to act. I'm not going to respond to this email or forward it to anyone else, or especially I'm not going to make a business decision on this email

462
00:57:16.330 --> 00:57:25.620
Danny Park: which a lot of a lot of people do. A lot of people make that mistake of read. They read an email. There's some useful data in there, but they automatically assume it's useful. But there's nothing in the email,

463
00:57:32.490 --> 00:57:36.820
Danny Park: then, after you know. So that's my first check

464
00:57:36.970 --> 00:57:41.120
Danny Park: right? Because emails are notorious for being late or read late.

465
00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:48.219
Danny Park: I've seen people read emails a week late with that data in there that's clearly about week old.

466
00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:51.390
Danny Park: The response email from that is a business decision.

467
00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:54.629
Danny Park: And that would just reply back that data is all. Try again.

468
00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:57.650
Danny Park: So that's number one, right?

469
00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:08.089
Danny Park: If it's timely right, i'm gonna ask myself, Okay, is everything shared with me in any email. Is it complete? Right? So then, I would ask, What's the business purpose

470
00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:20.970
Danny Park: like? I told you we talked about like having What's the purpose? What's the actual purpose of the analysis? You're doing for the leadership? So when I get this email, you know what's the topic, What's the purpose like what? What's the context around this business decision?

471
00:58:21.310 --> 00:58:30.319
Danny Park: So is the data that shared with me in that email? Is it complete enough for me to make a good business decision based on the topic or the context.

472
00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:33.789
Danny Park: Right? If it's. No. I go back to confirm

473
00:58:36.330 --> 00:58:37.750
Danny Park: bye bye,

474
00:58:38.110 --> 00:58:49.260
Danny Park: just want to, you know. Confirm, if you understand the sender, what the business purpose is, because this is how I understand what the business purpose is. I mean, If this business purpose I have

475
00:58:51.610 --> 00:59:00.449
Danny Park: accurate. Please provide me this this and this information because it's not complete right Now, you didn't give me enough information to make a business decision, because

476
00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:03.549
Danny Park: right the purpose is off,

477
00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:08.199
Danny Park: but my purpose is off. Might be all, for yours might be off

478
00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:12.489
Danny Park: all right. So let's then let's say, Now I have timeless and complete covered

479
00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:21.380
Danny Park: right? And again i'm confirming right, i'm confirmed confirmity is just the ability again the ability for me to trace

480
00:59:22.270 --> 00:59:24.280
Danny Park: back to the source.

481
00:59:24.570 --> 00:59:25.830
Danny Park: Two,

482
00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:42.479
Danny Park: you know, ensure accuracy and integrity, timeliness, completeness, and consistency, um or it's already been confirmed for me. So in this case before I'm using because you know, because I don't have a a sign off for a reviewer in place. Right? I'm using confirmity

483
00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:50.010
Danny Park: component to you know again to bolster or enhance my timeliness and my completeness. So let's say I, those two checked.

484
00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:57.389
Danny Park: The next thing obviously is that check for consistency, but usually in emails you really have to. But let's say I actually had a data file,

485
00:59:57.930 --> 01:00:01.680
Danny Park: right? I open it up, and I see different rows

486
01:00:02.550 --> 01:00:14.200
Danny Park: of data, right? And if I see the you know the same row, or maybe in the columns and columns, if they're kind of saying the same thing. Or if I don't understand the purpose of a particular column or a particular row,

487
01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:22.389
Danny Park: right or what it means? Right? I'm going to ask, Hey, what do you mean by row? I see a title of a row or a column.

488
01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:24.839
Danny Park: What is a definition of it?

489
01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:33.569
Danny Park: Right? So they use an example of the tax associate right? You know, and when they said non-activity income,

490
01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:48.760
Danny Park: the good thing would have been. Instead of assuming that something else the tax associate should have went. Oh, wait a minute! I've never seen that before Hey, manager, any more experience tax professional who's been on this engagement before I see non-activity income

491
01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:50.559
Danny Park: does that mean dividends,

492
01:00:51.450 --> 01:00:53.160
Danny Park: or what does that mean?

493
01:00:54.290 --> 01:00:58.189
Danny Park: All right. So now I'm I'm ensuring consistency.

494
01:01:00.970 --> 01:01:02.789
Danny Park: They're not going to look for accuracy,

495
01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:03.680
Danny Park: right?

496
01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:19.220
Danny Park: Right, like, you know, usually in emails for business leaders. It's like a check. Usually. I just, you know, use my intuition to say, Hey, I don't know if that looks. But I don't know if that looks okay. If I get it like a weird feeling around a number

497
01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:22.510
Danny Park: or even information I confirm.

498
01:01:23.310 --> 01:01:28.080
Danny Park: All right, Let's see the email says, you know. And this situation happened. And Yada Yada! Yada! Yada

499
01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:38.020
Danny Park: would come out of that meeting

500
01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:43.290
Danny Park: right then I would go look on the stakeholder, you know. Look on the list of people who attended the same meeting,

501
01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:50.939
Danny Park: right? And I was just asked a couple of them. Hey, I got, you know I got this email from So and so. And it said this like, Did you hear the same thing

502
01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:53.370
Danny Park: right? And they'll confirm that for me?

503
01:01:53.490 --> 01:01:57.469
Danny Park: All right. So it's accurate right the information. I'm getting the data I'm getting is accurate,

504
01:01:59.370 --> 01:02:18.200
Danny Park: Right? Integrity like it's an email. So I don't have to go fast far as to like kind of check. What you know if if the systems when it came from it just, you know, just outlook all right. So in that instance I don't really have to take your integrity. But i'm trying to explain. What I'm trying to show is how data quality is a job that all of us have to do.

505
01:02:19.150 --> 01:02:29.489
Danny Park: Okay, we can't. We can't assume automatically that the information data that we get automatically is timely complete, consistent, confirmed

506
01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:33.329
Danny Park: that has integrity.

507
01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:34.410
Danny Park: It's

508
01:02:35.010 --> 01:02:38.500
Danny Park: So that's a main takeaway from this session

509
01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:45.969
Danny Park: awesome. So we are at eight hundred and six. I think I don't have anything else wanted to cover

510
01:02:46.010 --> 01:03:07.680
Danny Park: um. If there are any questions, please feel free to. You know more than happen, you know. Please email me what set up office hours, and if you have any questions more than happy to get, you know. Go over it then, but as promised the first session, I mean the first fifteen minutes of our Friday sections will me will be me filling any questions anyone has
