1
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.640
Danny Park: Everybody

2
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:16.069
Danny Park: welcome to our lecture on the information system. So this lecture should be maybe about an hour, maybe a bit a little bit less, but

3
00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:30.450
Danny Park: a lot of the questions a lot of time. Usually, when I provide this uh discussion in a live session most of the time, most of that time is filled with, you know questions and answers. So

4
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.950
Danny Park: um again this boat,

5
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:52.750
Danny Park: when we meet on Friday, you know we have the first fifteen minutes to do A. Q. A. On it. So please more uh feel more than happy to, you know. Have a list of questions that you may want to ask um related to this lecture. But um! I'll try to be as detailed as possible.

6
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.649
Danny Park: All right. So diving right in right, so we can go to

7
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.290
Danny Park: What is the information system? All right, So let me just go ahead and delete this slide, because

8
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.190
Danny Park: no, we'll leave it, because this will kind of help us in the people's side. Um, right? So what is the information in the system?

9
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.899
Danny Park: All right. So I just want to make sure that

10
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.119
Danny Park: we have a good clarification

11
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.860
Danny Park: about when

12
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:29.889
Danny Park: what we should be thinking about when when others in technology refer to the information system versus information technology.

13
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.039
Danny Park: So some

14
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.139
Danny Park: this is capable.

15
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.210
Danny Park: They tend to use the term information technology

16
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.340
Danny Park: um to mean the information system,

17
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.510
Danny Park: right? So

18
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.789
Danny Park: what is the information system?

19
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.559
Danny Park: So it

20
00:01:53.010 --> 00:02:04.140
Danny Park: a system? Right? So let's first define system. A system is a group of interacting or related parts that must work with one another to deliver a product, service or expectation.

21
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.550
Danny Park: Right? So

22
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.190
Danny Park: when we

23
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.120
Danny Park: say information system, we're talked about all of the

24
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.950
Danny Park: components that are necessary

25
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.149
Danny Park: to deliver business value

26
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.480
Danny Park: today.

27
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:39.530
Danny Park: What's a What's a You know? What do we mean when we say information technology. So what information technology is one of the components of the system

28
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:51.450
Danny Park: that has to work with the other components to deliver value. So I guess a quick example would be just because you have let's say Google Suite at your company,

29
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.690
Danny Park: Google Suite alone by itself. Doesn't deliver any value. Right?

30
00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.480
Danny Park: No, it doesn't. It just provides the company with a set of capabilities, and

31
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.900
Danny Park: that

32
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:21.499
Danny Park: the other components can leverage to create synergies with one another to deliver ultimate business value. Right? So that's one important thing that I want to, you know. Just share across immediately is information system, or

33
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.279
Danny Park: includes all of the components

34
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.050
Danny Park: to deliver

35
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:36.480
Danny Park: business value and information. Technology is just one of the components that has to be part of right

36
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:45.309
Danny Park: creation of that business value. So what are the components of the information system? So it's.

37
00:03:47.570 --> 00:04:04.289
Danny Park: We'll talk general. So there are other ways to kind of depict or share what an information system is depending on on how technical you want to get versus how business focus you want to get. But since this is a non-technical class, let's just talk about the general.

38
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.690
Danny Park: You know business side component. So it's it that

39
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.739
Danny Park: these are the things that the business side should be thinking about

40
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.079
Danny Park: and how to integrate them to get the

41
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:26.560
Danny Park: strive or achieve the business strategy, since the business strategy by definition, should be the

42
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.280
Danny Park: path to generate value for that organization.

43
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.810
Danny Park: All right? So

44
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.100
Danny Park: the components are people

45
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:43.929
Danny Park: process technology, tools or capabilities, right? We just call it technology for short the data,

46
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:54.130
Danny Park: the Kpi's or Okr. So a Kpi is key performance indicator, and it Okr is objective key results

47
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.309
Danny Park: in short, basically measuring, measuring

48
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.590
Danny Park: our activities. Or if all these components together,

49
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:10.460
Danny Park: or meeting the outcomes that we want the desired outcomes meaning Is it? Are they achieving the value that we need?

50
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.450
Danny Park: All right? So

51
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.039
Danny Park: when we look at this pyramid right,

52
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.030
Danny Park: the four layers of digital business,

53
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.960
Danny Park: the business itself

54
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:39.440
Danny Park: right? There's also a business system, right? So you know. So what's a business system? So what we talk about business system. We're saying that. Okay. So what's the business? A business is the aggregation of different components as well, right? So so a business will have the finance, component

55
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:54.069
Danny Park: right or function, right finance, marketing, human resources and logistics. Um, compliance, law, legal governance. You know all these different components together make up the business system.

56
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.469
Danny Park: So within that business system the

57
00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:10.049
Danny Park: the business analysts question should be, okay, How within our business system we have people, process technologies and the data.

58
00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.109
Danny Park: How do I help the organization

59
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.730
Danny Park: take the information system that we have

60
00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.390
Danny Park: right and align it toward the business

61
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.750
Danny Park: system.

62
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.080
Danny Park: Right? So at each layer of the business

63
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:38.229
Danny Park: the digital business meeting the business itself and the different components right. Each layer or function needs

64
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.530
Danny Park: its own set of people,

65
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.060
Danny Park: its own set of processes.

66
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:52.130
Danny Park: It's set its own unique technology and capabilities, and it's going to generate or require their own data.

67
00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:09.509
Danny Park: So at each layer the purpose is to figure out okay, what people do. I need? What processes do I need? What technologies do I need and what's the data available, and what data do I want to generate?

68
00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.440
Danny Park: Achieve the

69
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.420
Danny Park: key performance indicators

70
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.190
Danny Park: that we have established.

71
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.379
Danny Park: All right. So

72
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.690
Danny Park: the business analyst would be assessing each component.

73
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.490
Danny Park: So

74
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:29.940
Danny Park: here here's an example.

75
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.120
Danny Park: Let's say

76
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:39.009
Danny Park: the enterprise right? Or the business wants to adopt salesforce.

77
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.790
Danny Park: So salesforce

78
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.809
Danny Park: comes with it its own capabilities and tools.

79
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:53.290
Danny Park: So when we look at the technologies, capabilities, and tools. Right? We'll quickly realize that salesforce is

80
00:07:53.300 --> 00:08:00.090
Danny Park: a good alignment to the marketing and sales functional for the organization.

81
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:04.479
Danny Park: Okay. So now we have we understand the target

82
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.239
Danny Park: group of audience for that technology great.

83
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:16.029
Danny Park: But once we get into that marketing or sales group, right, and we're trying to implement salesforce,

84
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:21.100
Danny Park: we can't just give them sales forces and say, here, use it and boom the

85
00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:30.960
Danny Park: right. It automatically. The sales, the the sales organization, and the people in the marketing are gonna effectively use sales right? It never works that way.

86
00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:43.370
Danny Park: So as a business analyst, we have to say, okay, we think salesforce is. There is a good technology to bring into marketing and human resources. But let's are not human resources. There's a sales organization,

87
00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.950
Danny Park: So let's assess the people.

88
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.349
Danny Park: So you would look at the people. And you would start thinking about Okay,

89
00:08:52.770 --> 00:09:00.099
Danny Park: Who in marketing or sales, or in the sales organization, has you salesforce before? Right? So what's this skill sets

90
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:12.359
Danny Park: right. What do they have existing? Transferable skill sets that can help them adopt salesforce the right way? What other assessments would be? What are some of the backgrounds that individual has

91
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.490
Danny Park: right that may make them be, you know,

92
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:21.849
Danny Park: little bit more on the competent level competency level. To adopt salesforce

93
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:37.489
Danny Park: um. Other measures would be due to the people in the marketing and salesforce. Are they ready to adopt right? We talk about readiness all the time about, you know, right being ready to execute, ready to implement, ready to adopt. Are they ready?

94
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:55.460
Danny Park: Right? Do they have the time and the focus to to be able to understand and pick up salesforce to scale. So there are several different components of the factors of the people component of what we have to assess before we actually

95
00:09:55.650 --> 00:10:09.210
Danny Park: first identify the right technology or even bring it in. So in this instance we're questioning is salesforce, even the correct technology, right? So from a people component, we have to look at about the factors and understand if they're ready.

96
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:21.219
Danny Park: And then let's assume that you assess the people component, and you know they're they're they're ready to adopt a particular technology, right? These sales rooms, or something else.

97
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:32.769
Danny Park: The next part you have we have as analysts that we have to think about is the processes that are existing in that particular department or the business. Right? So let's say

98
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:36.920
Danny Park: they say the sales organization for a company isn't that mature

99
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:45.299
Danny Park: right? There's a lot of lack of standards, or there is. There's really no methodology around. Go to market.

100
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:53.870
Danny Park: The processes are really not that complex to date, because you know, the the organization just started

101
00:10:54.190 --> 00:11:03.350
Danny Park: right? So they're not really getting into, like, you know, huge amount of transactions they're just. They basically excel is fine for now, for example.

102
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:07.210
Danny Park: So if if the processes

103
00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:09.160
Danny Park: don't align

104
00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:16.709
Danny Park: to the capabilities of the technology, right? So if salesforce is providing us with, let's say

105
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:27.530
Danny Park: capabilities A, B, C and D, for example, and the processes that we assessed, the only capabilities that we need is A for now

106
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:33.390
Danny Park: is there an economic value

107
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:52.710
Danny Park: to adopt salesforce right? Probably not right, because the whole purpose of the information your system is to maximize value. You don't want to take on an extra cost that's not needed at that particular time. Right? So about timing and readiness, right? So that that that's one example of

108
00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.369
Danny Park: salesforce is not the right technology. Let's just keep excel

109
00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:12.760
Danny Park: right on the flip side. Let's say salesforce still provides A, B C and D from a capabilities perspective. But then our organizational processes. Right? We need capabilities. A, B, C. The Efg. X, Y. And Z.

110
00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:18.359
Danny Park: So additional capabilities, so meaning that the tick now a salesforce is not going to meet

111
00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:20.400
Danny Park: the needs

112
00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:23.889
Danny Park: of our organization from a process perspective.

113
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:34.439
Danny Park: So since salesforce is not providing is only providing a B C and D as a capability. Maybe there's another technology out there

114
00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:38.080
Danny Park: that will provide us additional capabilities that we need.

115
00:12:40.150 --> 00:13:03.519
Danny Park: Right. So ultimately the point again, just like how the people right, because people are the ones the people of the people are the main drivers and using technology and adopting it the correct way to generate value. We also have to understand that the processes that the people executing the processes themselves have to align to the technology that we want to bring in,

116
00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.320
and it's usually done at the capability level,

117
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:25.080
Danny Park: are there? What is there an opportunity to re-engineer? A set of processes to get them ready for A particular technology, of course, and that should be part of the assessment. So the assessment should be, What are the current state processes that our teams are executing that are delivering value

118
00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:34.120
Danny Park: with this particular technology that we have be able to create the efficiencies of those current processes. We,

119
00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.750
Danny Park: or

120
00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:48.210
Danny Park: is there an opportunity for us to re-engineer? Some of these processes to generate value without technology. And then, when they're ready, let's go ahead and implement the technology that we want.

121
00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:50.030
Danny Park: So

122
00:13:51.500 --> 00:14:06.970
Danny Park: that's why why that's Why, it is very important to assess not only the technologies capabilities for fit, but we have to also look at the people and process. So this is this, that assessment right there.

123
00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:09.090
Danny Park: Yes,

124
00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:22.230
Danny Park: probably the most common error that's made in a lot of organizations a lot of organizations. They, when they think about the information system, they just automatically default to meeting meeting information technology.

125
00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:27.399
Danny Park: They assume the technology itself is going to bring with them the system

126
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:39.339
Danny Park: which is completely false. So what happens is, companies will buy these technologies and oldies, and you know salesforce erps, and, like all these, they'll bring it in

127
00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:47.410
Danny Park: and go. Oh, look! It's great investment. Look at all the capabilities that we have. If we buy this, it's gonna create so much value, and then when they buy it,

128
00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:58.849
Danny Park: then when they try to roll it out, meaning get people to use it, you know. I'm sure some in this class have felt this like you. Then, like the peanut galley opens up

129
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:10.809
Danny Park: right there first. There's a lot of people who are resisting this thing. Hey? Look! My excel is just fine. I don't want to It's the amount of time it takes me to relearn this tool. Come on, I don't want to deal with it. Let me just do my excel. Let me just get it over with. I want to go home,

130
00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:14.489
Danny Park: all right. So we got the resistance group right? The detractors.

131
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:25.860
Danny Park: Then you got honest like process, inefficiency or process misalignment where the process itself, the technologies just can't service that process,

132
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:40.409
Danny Park: I think. Oh, hey, thanks for the tech. But this is my process, and this tech doesn't. Do this, that this, that this. So I can't use your tech because it's not giving me any actual value. It's actually causing me rework

133
00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:48.599
Danny Park: You're introducing waste into my system, Or am I the way I work by introducing this technology that doesn't align to what I need

134
00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:51.619
Danny Park: happens all the time.

135
00:15:52.240 --> 00:16:10.489
Danny Park: So as a good business analyst again before we get to the data, we also talk about the soft side. You know the human component, the process component, because people, processes and technologies, those are all data points that we don't capture in numbers.

136
00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:19.490
Danny Park: Again, a business analyst doesn't mean, we're a dump or mathematician. We confuse that, too. When we think of business all as a data analyst

137
00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:23.810
Danny Park: people to be honest, a lot of people think about math.

138
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:33.909
Danny Park: But a analyst is beyond just math. If I wanted someone, or if the organization is wanting someone to run statistics all day, we will just hire mathematicians

139
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:37.950
Danny Park: like why wouldn't we? Why wouldn't we just go hire a bunch of math majors

140
00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:48.889
Danny Park: We don't because we're like No, the math involved. Isn't that advanced right. No one's gonna do advanced matrices or or you know

141
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:50.760
Danny Park: It's theoretical

142
00:16:50.860 --> 00:17:05.760
Danny Park: theoretical science, right? Theoretical reason. No one's doing that at our level at our normal business level. As an analyst. We need people who would just understand man, right? Just general. Be honestly just basic general statistics,

143
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.300
Danny Park: like regression and prediction,

144
00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:11.420
Danny Park: write probability models and distribution

145
00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:19.960
Danny Park: basically statistics. If you take in an entry level, and maybe some like middle-level statistics. Course you

146
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.110
Danny Park: right? Our stats like statistics around probabilities, that's all you need the

147
00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:32.280
Danny Park: really for being a really carving at a really strong career and analytics and data science.

148
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:35.270
Danny Park: So we don't need mathematicians

149
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:44.769
Danny Park: right? We need all around business focused people who can understand how to capture the data points that are not in the numbers.

150
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:52.759
Danny Park: So we could find alignment and all the components of a system to maximize value for the organization.

151
00:17:52.910 --> 00:18:01.059
Danny Park: Right? So again, assessing people, process technology is very important, and the last thing not less certain. Let not least is the data.

152
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:05.989
Danny Park: This is where another pain point that a lot of companies end up having

153
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:06.930
Danny Park: is.

154
00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:16.789
Danny Park: People take data for granted. They assume the data sets they have like. We We talked about this earlier. They assume that data sets that they have is ready,

155
00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:21.669
Danny Park: right. And if you actually ask your organization,

156
00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:30.599
Danny Park: I mean, I would challenge everyone to do it. Just ask random people that you know in your work. Say, hey, what do you? What I define data rating Inst: from what's data quality to you,

157
00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:37.719
Danny Park: then? Asks someone else, and to ask someone else, you would most likely you probably find the definition of data quality be different.

158
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:41.210
Danny Park: Some may not even know what you're talking about.

159
00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:49.499
Danny Park: If we don't understand our data ecosystem, how can we ever pick the technology

160
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:57.640
Danny Park: right? How can we ever say our processes are optimized. If we don't understand the data that's coming out of it,

161
00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:59.999
Danny Park: or even if it's the right data,

162
00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:04.950
Danny Park: how the processes are contributing

163
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:07.490
Danny Park: to data quality for the organization,

164
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:25.769
Danny Park: or if they're actually wasteful, because the data going again already is not, is not good. So the process, even though the process is good. The ingredients they're working with so poor the outputs is outputting something that is not really driving to the maximum value. We just think it's valuable,

165
00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:35.900
Danny Park: but it might be but as a business analyst the question is, No, no, no, is it the question is this valuable? The question is, is this the most value that we could possibly get.

166
00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:54.619
Danny Park: If you think about it, just think about Ah, you know, like a toothpaste an allergy like, Are you gonna squeeze half of it and throw it away. No, you're gonna keep squeezing and squeezing It's gonna squeeze up so you can't get anything else out of it. That's the mindset that we have to have about value, or we squeezing every minuscule

167
00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:06.879
Danny Park: part of value from this process. So every time this process executes is the end outcome. The acts, the absolute value that it could possibly provide.

168
00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.910
Danny Park: Just doing math is not going to get us there.

169
00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:32.640
Danny Park: So data data we have to talk. We have when we assess the data. When we we talked about this in our very first lecture, we have to assess the quality of the data in the organization that's looking to adopt the technology. No technology should ever be purchased

170
00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.460
Danny Park: invested in

171
00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:47.470
Danny Park: until we get a good understanding. If the data that sets that we have will align to that tech. There are plenty of technologies out there where the data sets that the organization has is just not compatible.

172
00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:56.180
Danny Park: There has to be so much work done on the data to prep it to get it into the tool. In the first place, it's like you have an automated tool to,

173
00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:04.929
Danny Park: But to you as an automated tool, you have to do a lot of manual work on the data to get it into the right structure to use the automated tool. So

174
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:19.359
Danny Park: you're actually you created waste that we work, and all the manual efforts to get the data ready and prep you introduce waste to to use the actual invested tool. So you invested money.

175
00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:31.390
Danny Park: You expected one hundred dollars of value, for for example. But then, let's Say, you tell the company, hey? If we adopt this particular technical technology, A: If you get the job, technology A, we're going to get one hundred thousand value

176
00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:48.190
Danny Park: and yes, awesome. Buy it. So the you bought technology A. Then you give it to the the operations team and the operations. Teams take a look and they go. Hmm. Okay, for us to use this. We have to do all this work on the data to get it into a ready format for the tool to accept

177
00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.230
Danny Park: cool, and then all that work.

178
00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:56.829
Danny Park: That's the data that that operation team has to do. Let's say It's going to cost them forty dollars.

179
00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:04.779
Danny Park: So your value investment, the maximum value that you expected to get from to a is one hundred. But you spent forty. So it was actually sixty.

180
00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:11.869
Danny Park: It doesn't make any sense

181
00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:17.850
Danny Park: to add in a additional forty waste forty forty dollars of waste

182
00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:30.350
Danny Park: just to adopt a tool? Is there another tool, or is it another tool that already readily adapts to our data model or a set that we have in the organization? Or

183
00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:34.019
do we have to have conversations upstream

184
00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:36.650
Danny Park: around the theater quality first,

185
00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:43.220
Danny Park: so our teams will have to all this manual effort before we go ahead and grab that technology and bring it in

186
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:49.759
Danny Park: right. So all those, all those concepts around opportunity, cost,

187
00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:56.099
Danny Park: and and risk management. It applies to a Ba.

188
00:22:56.630 --> 00:23:00.520
Danny Park: Business, at least, if you think about risk and value and cost

189
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:02.260
Danny Park: identification

190
00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:06.320
Danny Park: the most out of any role in the organization,

191
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:12.699
Danny Park: right? And then ultimately, what the K. Pr. Is? The okay? Are they telling us? Is it.

192
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:15.989
No, we have a desired set of outcomes that we want.

193
00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.550
Danny Park: In theory.

194
00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:26.490
Danny Park: These other four components should be working well in a synergistic way to help us achieve the

195
00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:33.399
Danny Park: or not only achieve, but even exceed our eight kpis or cares that we want

196
00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:36.500
Danny Park: all right. So

197
00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.169
Danny Park: as another, I would say

198
00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:48.789
Danny Park: a practical pop that I've seen in my career is that a lot of organizations They kind of. They don't really put in thoughtful Kpi.

199
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:57.979
Danny Park: The Kpi is an Okrs have to be realistic. So how can you develop realistic

200
00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:03.140
Danny Park: Kpis and Okrs? If you don't understand your other four components?

201
00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:11.709
Danny Park: Right? Let's say, you assess your people as saying, I saying, that's a your system like one hundred percent of them want to adopt a tool like overnight,

202
00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:20.609
Danny Park: right? So adoption rate is going to be a hundred percent of the tool that you want in the in the system. It's going to be a hundred percent adoption rate within sixty days. So

203
00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:29.979
Danny Park: So then, let's say you accounted your Kpi so that you're assuming that the technology that save you money will make or either save you money or generate more money.

204
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:39.190
Danny Park: It's one or the other Right? You don't really invest in technology. If it's not going to either save you more money than the investment you made, or it's going to make you more money than an investment you made

205
00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.049
Danny Park: right. Is it obvious

206
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:52.990
Danny Park: so? But that requires people to use it? So if you wrongfully assume that one hundred percent adoption rate within. Let's say, six. Well, three months, or whatever. Just use this for you six weeks

207
00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:04.199
Danny Park: with the technology, And then you are saying, Okay, great by six by the sixth week I'm going to have one hundred percent adoption. So then I expect to make a million dollars more. This court,

208
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:15.840
Danny Park: right? So you built in on achievable Kpi, based on your wrong, full assumptions about one or multiple components of your system.

209
00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:23.710
Danny Park: So having. Kp: is that unrealistic? That's the best way to destroy the adoption of a technology,

210
00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.690
Danny Park: the adoption of a new process,

211
00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.669
Danny Park: or your people are going to want to leave the company

212
00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:36.069
Danny Park: right, or your data sets like you even would have improving it. So

213
00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:38.980
Danny Park: this is very important

214
00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:47.740
Danny Park: can actually degrade

215
00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.790
Danny Park: the other components of the business system,

216
00:25:51.800 --> 00:26:00.719
Danny Park: but you see it's kind of like a chicken egg problem. But or on the flip side, if you don't have a good assessment of your components. You have bad kpis. So that's all we say.

217
00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:19.000
Danny Park: That's what a Kpi is. Okay, are are included in the component of the business system. All of these have to be integrated, and and and and synergies have to be created. So a business, Alice is assessing everything. It's assessing people process tech data, kpis, and they doing it again, doing it again, doing it again and doing it again.

218
00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:20.810
Danny Park: Two

219
00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:23.030
Danny Park: chip away

220
00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:30.839
Danny Park: the and the gaps that each component has. That's preventing those components to align well together.

221
00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:33.729
Danny Park: So a very good business analyst

222
00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:43.840
Danny Park: over time working to create a value-driven information system.

223
00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:50.460
Danny Park: No information system on this planet will have a hundred percent alignment on these five components.

224
00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:55.730
Danny Park: But a good business analyst is assessing each to figure out

225
00:26:56.250 --> 00:27:10.319
Danny Park: the continuous improvement efforts that each component needs to make sure that the five of these five components are jelling together. So that is what we mean by continuous improve for those who've heard that term. But Don't understand what they do.

226
00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:21.490
Danny Park: Continuous improvement, office, or continuous improvement efforts within. Let's say a Pmo. Or a operations excellence organization of the company.

227
00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:24.179
Danny Park: They have a bunch of business analysts,

228
00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:33.130
Danny Park: right? What people who adopt those core capabilities and expertise, who are continuously assessing these components for alignment,

229
00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:50.570
Danny Park: the organization or in their careers, understanding the how to really make these components work,

230
00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:56.230
Danny Park: because each executive office is charged to maximize value for the stakeholder.

231
00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:58.990
Danny Park: And how else do you maximize,

232
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:07.740
Danny Park: not generating value. That's a different I know I know a lot of Nba courts, they say, create value. That's not the question. The question is, are you maximizing that

233
00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:14.039
Danny Park: that's what executives do. They try to maximize the value of the organization, the

234
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:17.010
Danny Park: by the theory of infinite growth?

235
00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:30.720
Danny Park: So sooner we think in our it as business analysts how to maximize value and everything that we do, even in our personal. Let's say you want to go for a job, and you need a right certification.

236
00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:37.490
Danny Park: Does that? Is that certification or that degree really going to maximize the value?

237
00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.729
Danny Park: What you want from it?

238
00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:49.050
Danny Park: Right? What's your desired outcome. You want to go work for Google. Well, that degree of sort of certification really set you up for success. This Is it really valuable

239
00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:54.200
Danny Park: there another degree or no other certification. You need to get that. You don't know about

240
00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.940
Danny Park: as a business analyst.

241
00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:02.870
Danny Park: How are you assessing your systems components to make you competitive

242
00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:05.350
Danny Park: to work at the top tier companies,

243
00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:13.100
Danny Park: because in theory, until you're ready meaning until you assess your situation, how can you assess the situation of a business

244
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:16.950
Danny Park: which so

245
00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.610
Danny Park: a lot of important takeaways there.

246
00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:26.319
Danny Park: So we talked about people. I just have one people as a slide, just to show

247
00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:42.359
Danny Park: some things to assess. And the reason why I kind of call out people you notice I don't call any of the other components because it's it's really self-explanatory. We're called out a little bit here and here, but the people I want to really talk about, because this is where everything really

248
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:48.069
Danny Park: people take. If data is one place you take for granted to other people. The other part they take for granted is people,

249
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.680
Danny Park: and it really comes down to

250
00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.030
Danny Park: the understanding between leadership and management

251
00:29:55.610 --> 00:30:01.179
Danny Park: for those in this class. You guys are all Mbas, or you know, of all future Mba

252
00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:04.970
Danny Park: who are going to be, and who will be in leadership positions.

253
00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:08.359
Danny Park: We have to understand the difference between leadership and management.

254
00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:15.540
Danny Park: Okay, leadership is the ability to inspire someone through your own investments.

255
00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:27.740
Danny Park: And being just right. Justice is a huge thing to an employee. If they feel that something's unfair or unjust, you're going to lose a team, no matter how well you want to manage them

256
00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:34.839
Danny Park: with reward of punishment. Schemes or frameworks. If they seem something is unfair, They're not going to adopt

257
00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:45.740
Danny Park: right, or they're not to be inspired to do the right thing or invest their time into the business. So inspir, you know, leadership starts with ourselves, and making sure that we

258
00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:48.539
Danny Park: for portraying

259
00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:55.229
Danny Park: good ethics, morals, and justice, but also being able to share

260
00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:01.039
Danny Park: the what's in it for them just beyond the pay and the bonus

261
00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:04.010
Danny Park: right? So

262
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:05.390
Danny Park: that's leadership.

263
00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.849
Danny Park: Leadership is inspiring without the actual

264
00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:12.189
Danny Park: impact with the impact.

265
00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:15.050
Danny Park: When I walk into a room

266
00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:25.940
Danny Park: there's sometimes there are people with lower ranks and partners who are so inspirational that the other partners, even though that higher rank an impact

267
00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:32.490
Danny Park: they default to that senior manager or director for guidance and leadership.

268
00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:37.630
Danny Park: So leadership is something that's removed from the actual title or rank. The

269
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.110
Danny Park: The formal authority of an organization leadership is something that you build

270
00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:54.240
Danny Park: regardless of that rank. So what I see a lot of young professionals do, is they? They incorrectly think that leadership is tied to the rank.

271
00:31:54.680 --> 00:32:01.630
Danny Park: So when I see an associate come in, and I know for a fact, this associate has really good points and can lead.

272
00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:06.479
Danny Park: They stay quiet because they feel like Oh, they're not a leader yet. They.

273
00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:09.729
Danny Park: This can be further from the truth.

274
00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.909
Danny Park: There are several ways to become a leader,

275
00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:16.450
Danny Park: and rank is not one of them.

276
00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:23.079
Danny Park: We thought about it. There's several people who have high ranks who are terrible leaders

277
00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:40.830
Danny Park: keep that in mind because I see a lot of even even Mbas, who graduate, who start here at Pwc and Deloitte, and the Uipath, and all the places I worked where I noticed that they're not progressing in their careers as fast as they can, because they have this misalignment in their thinking.

278
00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:44.020
Danny Park: Assuming leadership is the rank,

279
00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:50.930
Danny Park: just like how people you know, most people incorrectly think that information technology is the information system.

280
00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.069
Danny Park: The rank does not bring leadership. The

281
00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:58.620
Danny Park: just like how information technology does not bring the system.

282
00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:01.290
Danny Park: So What's management

283
00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:06.660
Danny Park: management is nothing more than a set of best practices and frameworks that keeps

284
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:12.719
Danny Park: maintains the staff or the teams from doing the right actions at the right time.

285
00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:33.359
Danny Park: So things like project plans, timelines. Ah, punishment and reward. Right you get fire, performance, improvement plans, people go and perform well. You get more bonus and pay and promotion if you do well. So there are structures in place that manage the the the at minimum expected behaviors.

286
00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:40.769
Danny Park: That's necessary to keep generating on business value right so bare minimum.

287
00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:46.409
Danny Park: So anyone who thinks that pay and bonus structure is what maximizes value

288
00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:54.319
Danny Park: for an open meeting. It's going to incentivize a group of a team to really maximize value. They're wrong.

289
00:33:54.500 --> 00:34:01.720
Danny Park: What maximizes value for an organization from a team perspective is leadership, the inspiration,

290
00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.290
Danny Park: the management,

291
00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:10.039
Danny Park: a set of frameworks and protocols in place to tell the teams

292
00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:15.119
Danny Park: or individual team members What is a baseline expectation of them

293
00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:21.209
Danny Park: that's going to help continue to business, generate, value.

294
00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:23.789
Danny Park: My generate value is management

295
00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:30.540
Danny Park: maximize value is leadership. That's why people who show leadership potential get promoted.

296
00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:38.310
Danny Park: And I hear this all the time, and i'll end with this Um, You know sharing.

297
00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:51.979
Danny Park: And when I because I coach a lot of people, and I coach a lot of professionals, I actually do some side coaching, too, or career coaching, and here's what I hear the common theme. When I hear people say I feel like I stole my career, and I asked them what they did.

298
00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:54.870
Danny Park: They were all great managers,

299
00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.660
Danny Park: but they didn't focus on leading.

300
00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:03.989
Danny Park: I share with them that idea like what what they did wrong, and they realized, Oh, that's right

301
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:07.030
Danny Park: Would I really be honest about it?

302
00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:11.520
Danny Park: My management duties is actually just. Maintain the status quo,

303
00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:23.760
Danny Park: and my and I have some team members there who are kind of exceeding right, because they themselves are leaders, Right? Because they're They're inspiring themselves to do better.

304
00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:30.290
Danny Park: But the team itself is just status quo, because i'm actually just managing them.

305
00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:42.039
Danny Park: I haven't really led them. I haven't really inspired them. I haven't really looked at the team and found people who are actually exceeding and through inspiration like to, you know, giving them, you know, accolades or pads in the back

306
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:59.480
Danny Park: right? And what a great job! And just sharing with so like sharing their contribution just beyond the usual pay and bonus structure, you know, like what the organization has that gets everyone to. Oh, oh, wow, wow! Look, look! That person did this, and they're being recognized. And I'm hearing from Danny, like you know

307
00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:15.250
Danny Park: what it means to own your career and how to do it, and he want. He's really interested in us as people not just part of you know, part of Pwc. Or Deloitte. He's really interested in our own personal growth, you know. Be it both here and and and in our personal life

308
00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:17.900
Danny Park: awesome, and that's leadership.

309
00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:30.140
Danny Park: So a good way to gauge leadership is to see your team and see how many people are raising their hand to go above and beyond what's necessary for them to maintain the status quo.

310
00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:41.420
Danny Park: So the more people that raise your hands to do it. It kind of shows that you, being a really good leader, and that's recognized by a senior leadership, that. Oh, this person!

311
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:50.390
Danny Park: It's so so inspirational, because getting the most out of that two things to is squeezing every value from it.

312
00:36:52.940 --> 00:37:05.519
Danny Park: We need someone like that to take on these additional responsibilities, building out a new project building on your business unit or going on a key initiative, a high visibility initiative that many senior leaders are focused on.

313
00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:14.129
Danny Park: So this is very important, if any, If we're doing management alone, you're going to have high turnover rate,

314
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:15.450
Danny Park: please

315
00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:21.420
Danny Park: to tie out our

316
00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:28.130
Danny Park: discussion. So now let's talk about process. Right? Process is basically like the

317
00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:35.140
Danny Park: Okay, What's the process? So a process is a set of activities that occur within some sequential order.

318
00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:38.390
Danny Park: But as business analysts

319
00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:44.010
Danny Park: we can just say, Oh, this process is happening. That's the correct order of things.

320
00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:45.879
Danny Park: It doesn't make any sense,

321
00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:47.790
Danny Park: all right. So

322
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:59.239
Danny Park: one of the easiest things a business analysis can do when they're assessing a process is they look at the process, and they get the end to end, and within each activity

323
00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:04.650
Danny Park: you should be able to bucket in them into two buckets, either mandatory or

324
00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:06.950
Danny Park: or discretionary.

325
00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.359
Danny Park: So a mandatory dependency would be

326
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:17.200
Danny Park: activity. A must happen in order for activity. B to happen

327
00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:20.779
Danny Park: right? So it must.

328
00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:22.550
Danny Park: It has to be there.

329
00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.889
Danny Park: It's not optional

330
00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:30.409
Danny Park: right. And you see here, I you know you list some, maybe some reasons why

331
00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:40.220
Danny Park: purposes for justification as to why a particular activity is mandatory right? Most often it's because it's legally bound

332
00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:44.920
Danny Park: right. For example, the big four, the audit practice,

333
00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:48.110
Danny Park: every process and audit

334
00:38:48.420 --> 00:39:06.789
Danny Park: is required only because not every process. Yeah, Well, actually every process. But let's think about it from a a regulation perspective. So i'll say it this way If the Sec. Said tomorrow that public companies don't need an independent audit to trade on the public stock market,

335
00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:10.369
Danny Park: right in the stock and in the markets.

336
00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:14.660
Danny Park: The assurance and audit service lines will go away.

337
00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:22.350
Danny Park: Because why would a company spend money on a set up processes and activities that became discretionary

338
00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:31.899
Danny Park: meaning. There's no law now that says Apple has to get audited by E. And Y or Pwc. Whoever that does their audit to go trade

339
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:36.490
Danny Park: right? So

340
00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:49.119
Danny Park: many business processes that that a lot of businesses spend on right now, but as as business leaders. We can't think about our own myopic world, but think about broader right as Nba's. We think broad.

341
00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:50.610
Danny Park: Think about it.

342
00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:52.429
Danny Park: The whole ecosystem

343
00:39:53.970 --> 00:39:55.430
Danny Park: of business.

344
00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:58.779
Danny Park: It is governed by a set of laws and processes.

345
00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:03.900
Danny Park: I mean our laws, regulation, best practices, and all these other things

346
00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:06.670
Danny Park: companies. Because of that

347
00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:13.860
Danny Park: they become mandatory dependencies. So legal and contractual requirements is the main driver in making it activity

348
00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:18.039
Danny Park: a mandatory dependency. So a must happen before B,

349
00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:20.740
Danny Park: especially if you're in finance.

350
00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:37.579
Danny Park: And then there are some other reasons why i'm not saying Legal and contractual requirements are the only reason why it makes an activity a requirement. But that's a really good starting point to really assess an actual activity

351
00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:40.770
Danny Park: there.

352
00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:46.339
Danny Park: Next, What you want to look at is like the large the lodge behind it. So let's say

353
00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:50.109
Danny Park: I want to use and say activity. B is

354
00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:52.500
Danny Park: uploading

355
00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:55.919
Danny Park: a customized template

356
00:40:56.590 --> 00:41:01.050
Danny Park: to Machine B Right? So that's activity. B:

357
00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:09.970
Danny Park: So to do that to achieve B. I must do activity A, which is create the customized template,

358
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:18.270
Danny Park: because there's no other way for this application to work. So that's hard logic. Okay, Obviously it has to follow

359
00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:20.629
Danny Park: right. There's no rule of law

360
00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:26.599
Danny Park: that governs this. But when I talk about the rule of law of being logical.

361
00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:32.829
Danny Park: It's governed by an actual logic like I needed to do activity. B: Right? So it's a mandatory dependency.

362
00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:41.120
Danny Park: Other activities in the same process can be discretionary, so optional the

363
00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:46.659
Danny Park: When we talk about process optimization,

364
00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:50.290
Danny Park: it's really an exercise of understanding

365
00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:54.559
Danny Park: the which activities are mandatory versus discretionary.

366
00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.080
Danny Park: Why, the

367
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:59.339
Danny Park: activities are mandatory,

368
00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:03.499
Danny Park: then, from the discretionary, the

369
00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:11.029
Danny Park: asking ourselves if that discretionary activity is contributing to maximizing value

370
00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:16.090
Danny Park: it doesn't contribute to maximizing value,

371
00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:23.820
Danny Park: then an argument. It might not be necessary.

372
00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:37.720
Danny Park: So if you have an activity that's not necessary to achieve maximum value, and it's unnecessary to do it at all, why not eliminate? Because if you eliminate that activity you're saving either time or money.

373
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:43.510
Danny Park: So, by the elimination of the discretionary dependency or the activity

374
00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:47.919
Danny Park: then you are creating, You're gaining.

375
00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:52.480
Danny Park: You have maximizing value by eliminating waste.

376
00:42:53.890 --> 00:43:00.459
Danny Park: So that's what a business analyst does when it comes to process optimization.

377
00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:21.510
Danny Park: And again, it's not really about the numbers you could use numbers at the end. Gauge. How successful, how much value you maximize or gain from your your process. Optimization, exercise, but the actual effort of doing it doesn't require numbers. It requires business sense and stakeholder management,

378
00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:26.850
Danny Park: because sometimes a discretionary activity is done only because it's political,

379
00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:41.879
Danny Park: and we have to be able to navigate successfully the stakeholder ecosystem to make sure that we can have everyone aligned, become champions in removing that activity. That's wasteful.

380
00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:47.619
Danny Park: It's all right.

381
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:49.060
Danny Park: It's

382
00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:58.199
Danny Park: just go into a technology slide, right? And then we'll end our discussion here. So technology, tools and capabilities is basically just talk about, hey? Look at all these technologies we have in the market.

383
00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:06.089
Danny Park: Right? So for this, I just used intelligent automations, the Rpa industry

384
00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:07.129
Danny Park: to show.

385
00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:27.629
Danny Park: So within one segment of technology, tools and capabilities. Look at how many, how many there are which one should be used? We use you ipad. Do we use web services, Amazon? Do we go to a sure Do we go to Co. At which one? That's what a business analyst Answer:

386
00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:34.950
Danny Park: A business analyst has to have a good, strong understanding and how to do research around the capabilities of tools,

387
00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:49.860
Danny Park: and as I referenced before in this class, a good business analyst, you know, should be reading on, like, you know, think tanks and research organizations like Gartner and Forrester, the For the Wave and Gartner. They provide

388
00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:59.229
Danny Park: a quick, graphical view which tools are leading from a capability and value perspective for that, for an for an industry.

389
00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:05.330
Danny Park: All right. So these are two graphs that are published by Forrester

390
00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:08.290
Danny Park: and Gardner

391
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:10.850
Danny Park: related to Pegging

392
00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:16.439
Danny Park: um, not only the tool, but the service provider

393
00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:20.639
Danny Park: against intelligent automation.

394
00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:33.390
Danny Park: All right. So what do I put a service provider? So I sort of, for example, as a business analyst. You will be asked sometimes to assess the actual vendors. So Deloitte and Pwc. And E. And why we did consulting work around intelligent automation.

395
00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:38.139
Danny Park: So you, as a business analyst, say, let's say for Apple,

396
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:41.930
Danny Park: your Cfo might come to you and say, Hey, we want to do a vendor assessment.

397
00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:44.200
Danny Park: You

398
00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:57.260
Danny Park: do your research and assess? Which vendor right? Is it Deloitte, Pwc. Kpmg. Essential which one of them is the best fit for our information system?

399
00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:01.480
Danny Park: Do they have the right people?

400
00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:06.909
Danny Park: Do they have the right methodology and process? Are they bringing in the right tools?

401
00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:15.079
Danny Park: Right? Because some organizations have alliance partnership with some tools and others have alliance partnerships with others

402
00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:19.669
Danny Park: right? What is their definition of data

403
00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:21.500
Danny Park: or data quality?

404
00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:23.069
Danny Park: Are they ready?

405
00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:25.239
Danny Park: Are we aligned to them?

406
00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:31.410
Danny Park: What do they view as being the desired outcome? This is alliance, what we need

407
00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:51.530
Danny Park: Right so, and that's why I put capabilities, capabilities in this day and age, and and our current model of business in this world, the global model. Our capabilities no longer just comes from technologies and tools. It actually does come from service providers as well. Consultancy,

408
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:55.419
Danny Park: Theive was the sess

409
00:46:55.930 --> 00:47:03.620
Danny Park: consultancy, just like how we would assess any technologies to like us people process technology data, Kpi: So,

410
00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:08.889
Danny Park: because as a future executive for those in this room.

411
00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:10.770
Danny Park: We're all future executives.

412
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:17.370
Danny Park: You'll be making decisions on Who to contract with, to bring into your organization to maximize the value

413
00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:18.910
Danny Park: of your organization.
