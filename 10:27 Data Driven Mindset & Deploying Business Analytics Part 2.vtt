1
00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:11.770
Danny Park: Alright. So today, we're gonna we're gonna finish out. What we started last week was, you know, the the concept and discussion around digital mindset.

2
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:13.790
Danny Park: And

3
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.119
Danny Park: why? That's important from a analytic perspective, right?

4
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.780
Danny Park: The problem being.

5
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:31.680
Danny Park: if you go back to the first slide, the problem being that that's a problem. The fact that matter is business analytics has 2 layers.

6
00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:40.330
Danny Park: And to be really good in business analytics, right? For an organization to be very good in business analytics. They need

7
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.389
Danny Park: team members who are very strong in the business analysis, layer meaning.

8
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:57.079
Danny Park: the business experience, right, the industry, experience, the the the wisdom and knowledge they collected over years of practicing

9
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.550
Danny Park: within that industry and speaking with many partners and many stakeholders.

10
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.209
Danny Park: And they also need a data analytic layer. Right?

11
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:15.159
Danny Park: The you know, meaning the organization needs to have a function where they have not only team members are really good, and and, you know, doing statistics, but

12
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.860
Danny Park: having a good understanding of, based on the business

13
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.660
Danny Park: facts.

14
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:33.889
Danny Park: to know which data analytic technique to bring in. to provide the best answers in that moment of time.

15
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.439
Danny Park: to be able to move through the business analytics cycle

16
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:49.530
Danny Park: right? And the business analytics cycle is in in high level. In general, it's really 3 phases, or we could kind of sum it up to 3 questions is, first, we have to.

17
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.100
We have to answer what's happening. Now.

18
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.890
Danny Park: then, after we figure out what's happening now to us today, meaning our organization.

19
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:12.479
Danny Park: Then we have to sort of figure out what will happen next, right by looking into the market. Looking at other other. you know, speaking to other stakeholders who share their knowledge

20
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.130
Danny Park: and then gathering the associated data

21
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.649
Danny Park: to really answer, what's gonna happen next. And so once you know

22
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:30.529
Danny Park: what's happening right now to your organization, and what will happen next in market, then you'll be able to answer, or then you should be. Then you should ask, what should we do?

23
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:39.689
Danny Park: And then you're gonna bring in, you know, the next layer of business analysis, along with its associated data analytic layer.

24
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.329
Danny Park: And we talked about how in the data, analytic data, analytics, right?

25
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.510
Danny Park: Yes, it's definitely a

26
00:02:50.430 --> 00:03:00.610
Danny Park:  a skill set that we need in the in the organization. But we have to very aware of everyone in the organization understanding how they create data.

27
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.169
Danny Park: right? Because our analytics is as good as a data available to us.

28
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:12.210
Danny Park: and not only the the availability of that data, but the quality of it.

29
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:20.739
Danny Park: So we have to understand that when Staff are working they have to. You know, they're they're act. They're they have to that. They're creating

30
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:31.309
Danny Park: data right? But we have to make sure that that they're they're aware of a digital mindset. So they could actually create the data in a high quality way. And we talked about how digital literacy

31
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.450
Danny Park: is the driver

32
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.609
Danny Park: that helps with the digital mindset.

33
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:44.979
Danny Park: right? And we talked about how digital literacy is not just about just giving people a tool and saying, Here you go

34
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.369
Danny Park: right. You're ready to create data.

35
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:58.060
Danny Park: right? Because we have to understand that when we create data that's impacting our organization's data lifecycle, right? And we talked about that extensively. So you know in the course so far.

36
00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:12.020
Danny Park: So if we want to create high quality data that's useful. right for our data analytics that's going to pair with our business analysis. Just giving people tools is not enough

37
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.399
Danny Park: that we have to provide a roadmap

38
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:30.500
Danny Park: or a training methodology to help our staff go from just using the tool to understanding the purpose behind the actual tool meaning. What's the actual full capabilities? And why are we actually using in the organization?

39
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:39.920
Danny Park: And once we understand the purpose of the tool. Then we could create the specific data points that we want that we need and want to feed into our organization's data lifecycle

40
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:54.359
Danny Park: cause that did a life cycle is going to impact our data strategy which our data strategy will impact our technology strategy. Then our technology strategy will impact not only our talent strategy, but also our business strategy.

41
00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.210
Danny Park: Right? And a lot of great examples are brought up.

42
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.189
Danny Park: last session

43
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.160
Danny Park: around digital literacy

44
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:11.520
Danny Park: and a lot of great examples. Then we talked about the difference between digitization and digitalization.

45
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:18.649
Danny Park: Right? Digitization is basically turning things that were, but that previously were not in digital format

46
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:30.919
Danny Park: into digital format. Right? Example. I mean a great example, like easy, quick example of technology that's been around forever. Right? Is your scanner. Right? You had a a piece of paper.

47
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:39.220
Danny Park: and you needed to get it into a computer, a a basically a soft, we call a soft copy meaning you want it digitized

48
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.989
Danny Park: right? The ones and zeros, if you will.

49
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:51.110
Danny Park: Right? So you just basically put it in in that scanner that the machine scans it and then would give you, you know, the file back. Then it was just like

50
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:58.759
Danny Park: like a static, like Pdf, file like I'm aging myself like it wasn't even. Pdf, I think it was like a text file, whatever it was a dot txt.

51
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.879
Danny Park: But now we have scanners that give us multiple different

52
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:09.790
Danny Park: file formats. Right? The advanced ones, actually turning it into like expell spreadsheet spreadsheets.

53
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:20.740
Danny Park: So digitize that that's what digitization is by turning things into the digital format. And once you're turning things or getting things in digital format.

54
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:35.700
Danny Park: Right? Then, you could really start a digitalization in a more broader sense, meaning you could start building processes and how to use digital technologies to consume what you just digitized.

55
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:48.389
Danny Park: Right? So an example would be, you know, a quick, easy example between the marriage of digitization. And then digitalization is you're taking that that piece of paper. You're scanning it.

56
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:59.789
Danny Park: You're going to make the scanner turn it into a a spreadsheet format. Then you're going to go ahead and pull that into your Excel work paper, and then you're going to start doing some process

57
00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:11.830
Danny Park: right? So before, without the without the marriage between digitization digitalization. Let's say you want to like, do calculations right back, then you would actually do it on that piece of paper

58
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:27.050
Danny Park: right? And make notes on it, and then file it in your large file cabinets, right for those who are old enough to remember those giant file cabinets, and you have to go back and figure out where you've you know where the client file was and where the calculations are, and you're manually doing it. Everything

59
00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:42.929
Danny Park: right? So in in our digital digital age, we're just doing all that in excel spreadsheets, right? The same calculations. And we've automated it to a degree. Right? Some functions. If functions lookups, some macros.

60
00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:43.920
Danny Park: Right?

61
00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:49.520
Danny Park: So we've automated calculations. And the only way we're able to do that create that efficiency

62
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.950
Danny Park: is through these 2 concepts the marriage between the 2

63
00:07:55.170 --> 00:08:12.489
Danny Park: right? And you can see how there's limitations if you have a lot lot of digitization or in your organization. But you don't have a lot lot of digitalization like, okay, you just you. You have a lot of, you know, files saved in a server. But you're not doing any processing. You're not analyzing it

64
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:19.369
Danny Park: right on the flip side. If you have a lot of digitalization processing technologies available to you

65
00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.149
Danny Park: and staff. But you don't have the data meaning you didn't digitize much.

66
00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.049
Danny Park: So you have nothing to analyze.

67
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:38.909
Danny Park: Right? So these 2 things are very important. And the the the big, the big takeaway for us, I guess, taking, you know, putting taking our Mba hats off and putting our career hats on is.

68
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:42.710
Danny Park: where are you today?

69
00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.200
And digital literacy.

70
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:49.140
Danny Park: meaning how much actual, useful data

71
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:57.800
Danny Park: are you creating for your organization? And that's nothing that's in that question for the answer. It's a rhetorical question for all, all of us to kind of ponder.

72
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:04.910
Danny Park: Okay? Because in the new age with AI, what AI is, basically, you know, AI gen AI, generative AI,

73
00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:16.430
Danny Park: what what generative AI is is their digitalize. It's a digitalization effort. But closer to how humans will create content.

74
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:25.399
Danny Park: Right? Like Gen. AI, we have several different platforms out right now where they could turn text into a beautiful painting.

75
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:35.809
Danny Park: Right? It's generative. It's generating new content or creating something new. based on a given data set

76
00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:41.360
Danny Park: right. So Gen. AI is very digitally literate

77
00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:46.520
Danny Park: because they're creating new valuable things for us.

78
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:56.800
Danny Park: Right? So if we, if we think about the analogy right, think of a painter like a you know, like a Van Gogh. So while Van Gogh, what his mind did was.

79
00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:07.629
Danny Park: he took all of his experiences in life through his 5 senses, his smell, his touch, his taste, everything got inspiration. Analyze it in his mind, and he said.

80
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:11.790
Danny Park: Here is a scenario I want to paint. and through his.

81
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:21.149
Danny Park: you know, expression right through the to the through, the analytical coordination of his mind and his body, his painting, his painting.

82
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:37.670
Danny Park: So he created. Content like that stuff didn't come from any, didn't come from like poof out of the clouds. That's his interpretation of the world. And it was really great, because he's a very famous painter who will probably live on forever as long as a human species is is around. We will know Van Gogh.

83
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:44.830
Danny Park: So that's what generative AI generative AI is doing. It's is this digitalization.

84
00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:49.619
Danny Park: Again, it's digitalizing closer to how humans can do it.

85
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:57.559
Danny Park: So if we think just 5 or 6 years ago. Most of the digitalization technologies that we had in business analytics.

86
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:04.640
Danny Park: right, was not as advanced as Jane AI. There were. There were no, Van Gogh's out there. There's no system that can be like a Van Gogh.

87
00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.309
Danny Park: They could take a data set

88
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:13.659
Danny Park: draw in the context of what humans would like. and then create a painting that might sell and market

89
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.809
Danny Park: for a good decent amount of money.

90
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:24.850
Danny Park: right? Painting, meaning a digital painting. I'm not talking about like a machine that paints. Sorry I should talk. I should backtrack right?

91
00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:36.890
Danny Park: So digitization and digitalization, they're going to go hand in hand. Right? So, Jen AI. What Jane AI is doing is, think about it. It's creating new content

92
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:43.649
Danny Park: that we value right if you go here. So it's adding more to our data set pool.

93
00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:54.779
Danny Park: And then we're going to keep. It's going to keep making itself literate, as it, you know, even more literate or more valuable as it goes along, that's all. That's the that's that's the idea. That's the hope.

94
00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:56.389
Danny Park: right? The ideal.

95
00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:08.320
Danny Park: So for us when we talk about this illiteracy. So the question is, how do we, as business analysts. safeguard our value proposition against generative AI

96
00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:16.010
Danny Park: right generative? AI, since it's mimicking the way humans

97
00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.280
Danny Park: should or might create

98
00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:20.550
Danny Park: content

99
00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.649
Danny Park: if it gets better than us.

100
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:27.560
Danny Park: right, it's going to out-compete us.

101
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.079
Danny Park: right? So that that example I gave about it being at the

102
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:36.800
Danny Park: build a really great digital painting. Well, if you're in marketing

103
00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:48.550
Danny Park: and you are a designer. right? Marketing campaign designer. Right? So what they do is they do like what Van Gogh does right. They. They take data sets from customers. They analyze it.

104
00:12:48.600 --> 00:13:03.539
Danny Park: They do analysis, analyze, and they bring. They get their inspiration from. You know, they're very artistic, right? Some are. Some are actually have, like creative creative backgrounds, like painting or art. Right? So they bring in that inspiration along with the data analytic

105
00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:09.819
Danny Park: skills that they have, they come together and they bring forth a visual marketing campaign.

106
00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:17.650
Danny Park: I well, Jane AI is can do the same thing. So if you are a digital marketer, you have to ask yourself, Okay.

107
00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:23.830
Danny Park: what do I need to do from a digital literacy perspective to to stay at least

108
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:30.029
Danny Park: as good as Gen. AI. Or how can I contribute to making Gen. AI better?

109
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:42.069
Danny Park: And this space so that was, those would be my 2 ways of thinking about how I could safeguard my career if I were to choose to stay in my scope, my lane.

110
00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:48.280
Danny Park: and not have to transform myself too much and stay competitive against Gen. AI,

111
00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:54.110
Danny Park: right? So that marketing analytic, that's a business analytic role.

112
00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:09.490
Danny Park: Alright. So I just wanted to give that example for all the business analysts in the room. So we all are right. We all are business analysts to a degree like that's that's a skill set that we have to carry forward as you grow in our careers. So it's very important as business analysts

113
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:15.649
Danny Park: to not to forget the digital part right? And that was a whole takeaway from

114
00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.630
Danny Park: from from these 2, from these 2 slides is that

115
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.070
Danny Park: most business analytic courses.

116
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:36.229
Danny Park: They just they, they focus too much on the data, but not on all the other things that are important to make us stay competitive in the world of analytics. Because we have all these technologies out today that could actually do analytics for us.

117
00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:50.930
Danny Park: Alright. Then we talked about how there's some industries that are sort of falling behind versus some that have really ahead the curve when it comes to digit digit tisation.

118
00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:57.289
Danny Park: Okay, this is not talk about digitalization.

119
00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:03.530
Danny Park: So from a digitization perspective meaning they were, they're going from traditional paper

120
00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.120
Danny Park: and speaking

121
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:12.330
Danny Park: right? So data that's not captured in in in ones and zeros, right in digital format.

122
00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:17.619
Danny Park: And they moved into have moved well into being more digital.

123
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:35.099
Danny Park: right? And then you see professional services out there, you see financial and insurance, and you see some of the ones that we expect like construction and agricultural agricultural hunting. And when we see the red, we talked about how it's not about criticizing how bad they are from a business analyst perspective. That's opportunity for us.

124
00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:42.830
Danny Park: right? And we also kind of I didn't really mention too deeply. We talked about how I know the Mba programs.

125
00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:46.300
Danny Park: business analysts or the business analytic.

126
00:15:46.600 --> 00:16:04.910
Danny Park: major or focus it tends to. Only they only tend to feed financial services to us in the and Mba programs, right like, especially in New York City like when I talk to students, I never hear anyone talk to me about. They want to go into real estate, or mining, or education, or government or healthcare.

127
00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:10.899
Danny Park: where I'm in my mind, I'm like those are very lucrative. Industries, like oil and gas, is very lucrative.

128
00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:16.470
Danny Park: Oil and gas executives make tons of money. Some make more than financial services.

129
00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:25.289
Danny Park: Okay, so this is meant to show as MB. As we graduate like, you know, what? Don't think, that the business world only includes banking

130
00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:30.099
Danny Park: and finance, or accounting like, but I mean as an industry.

131
00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:41.210
Danny Park: those same finance, accounting, and business analytics. Skill sets those apply to all these industries, and I'll be like Whoa! Look, look at construction!

132
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:54.360
Danny Park: Let me look at the the biggest construction companies in New York City. There's a lot of money. My my father's in construction. So I know there's a lot of money in construction. There's a tons of money in construction. but no one's actually talking to them about digitization.

133
00:16:54.450 --> 00:17:08.870
Danny Park: and how that could enhance their analytics. I feel I will be a good opportunity for someone as with an Mba in this stuff, taking the BA. Track. and from from Barook to nominate themselves as a lead BA. For some construction company

134
00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:13.069
Danny Park: and work on how to bring in digitization.

135
00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:17.510
Danny Park: then layer in digitalization.

136
00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.710
Danny Park: So she or she or he

137
00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:22.170
Danny Park: can create

138
00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:26.930
Danny Park: the business analytic function for that construction company

139
00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:31.850
Danny Park: so they could execute the life cycle of business analytics.

140
00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:38.319
Danny Park: So this is how this all ties together, right from a career perspective.

141
00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:46.759
Danny Park: And I hope I hope that's helpful. So I'll send them a last we talked about this digital, how many companies.

142
00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:51.870
Danny Park: even though they're here right? Even though they are, let's say, in the green.

143
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:53.910
Danny Park: they're very digitized.

144
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:58.789
Danny Park: They confuse digitization with with

145
00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.940
Danny Park: digital transformation. So now.

146
00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:10.940
Danny Park: getting things that used to be not in digital format into digital format is not, you're not digitally transforming anything. He's just digitizing

147
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:38.020
Danny Park: digital transformation right? Using a description. Here is a series of deep, coordinated cultural workforce. Related technology shifts that enable new educational and operating models and transform an institutions, strategic direction and value proposition right? And we talked about how you know the example of Mckinsey. You know, they're in a a management consulting. They're they're deploying physical teams inside clients

148
00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:40.960
Danny Park: to do some type of strategy work.

149
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:45.939
Danny Park: So if one day this is they decided that, hey? You know what

150
00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:57.840
Danny Park: we can't find enough people anymore who are who are meeting client standards. Or we're so we're too pricey.

151
00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:16.999
Danny Park: Right? What's in what? How can we digitally transform our entire business operating model and and and doing some business analysis. We said that they're the leaders in the thought knowledge area of all things business. I mean. They touch every industry. It has a Mckinsey name on it. People pay attention to the to the white papers.

152
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:22.299
Danny Park: So what if they're able to digitize all of that knowledge within Mckinsey

153
00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:28.190
Danny Park: do digitalization, meaning build the processes and technologies to deliver on

154
00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:39.709
Danny Park: right that type of digitization and the analytic ability right layer in some AI mechanism that people can consume, and instead of going to clients, they just sell that to other consultancies.

155
00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:47.359
Danny Park: and then the other consultancies with their lessons learned, they feed back into the Mckinsey model, making Mckinsey's model smarter

156
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.150
Danny Park: or meaning, they create more value.

157
00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:56.179
Danny Park: So that would be digital transformation.

158
00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:00.790
Danny Park: So even as takeaways for everyone here as Mbas. Right

159
00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:05.369
Danny Park: from a top 50 Mba program. Now. who will be recognized in market

160
00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:14.290
Danny Park: right? Even if you go. You know what I'm not really interested in oil and gas, Danny, that's boring. I actually want to go stay in

161
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:23.400
Danny Park: financial services or insurance. You know what we know as what I. We understand the Mba some and Mba programs as being an Mba right

162
00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.329
Danny Park: being a banking professional.

163
00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:33.199
Danny Park: So I want to dive in there. And my role. I want my role to be able to bring on digital transformation.

164
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:39.139
Danny Park: Okay, so layer in the digitization and digitalization

165
00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:42.819
Danny Park: have it marry together

166
00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:49.349
Danny Park: to transform the way we work our business model and even our brand.

167
00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:59.820
Danny Park: Alright. So I'll start. So I was like a a quick sum of what we covered last time, and I'll then we'll finish out the rest of the slide, Dick. But any questions on what we what I covered so far

168
00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.960
Danny Park: alright, if not, let me keep going.

169
00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:07.660
Danny Park: So then, this is where

170
00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:13.769
Danny Park: this slide is just talking about the automation. Continue right? And this is a, this is a very important concept to bring in

171
00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:23.220
Danny Park: because actually, not many, not many business leaders, executives actually have this in mind. Right? So

172
00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:26.489
Danny Park: when we look at the automation continuum

173
00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:31.309
Danny Park: within an organization

174
00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:40.360
Danny Park: who has digitized. So the the premise or the or the the important fact of this slide is that we let's assume

175
00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.010
Danny Park: that that the organization has

176
00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:50.459
Danny Park: done excellent digitized digital digitization. So they they create a lot of digital.

177
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:57.750
Danny Park: They created a lot of data knowledge in digital format. Right? Things that were in paper now is in. Now it's in digital format.

178
00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:06.929
Danny Park: So now they need to bring on or bring in some automation technologies and skill sets to start processing

179
00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:18.629
Danny Park: that newly digital data, right? So they have to figure out from all that digital data, what what useful information and knowledge and other value can they can they derive from it

180
00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:24.000
Danny Park: right? Because you can't do it manually anymore. right? Because it's in digital format. It's obvious.

181
00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:27.079
So what the automation continuum was saying is like, hey?

182
00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:34.350
Danny Park: If you're in an organization that is not that has really not done any digitalization before is the first time you're doing it.

183
00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:38.240
Danny Park: it will be very foolish of you to say.

184
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:43.209
Danny Park: look at all the data that we just digitized. Let's just bring in AI,

185
00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.220
Danny Park: and let's just train an AI model

186
00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:51.780
Danny Park: to get us where we need to be right to do all the analysis and everything else

187
00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:53.070
Danny Park: right?

188
00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:56.550
Danny Park: What would? What are some of the issues with that?

189
00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.130
Danny Park: Anyone

190
00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:04.909
Danny Park: can you have no model to learn from?

191
00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.210
Danny Park: Great? Go ahead, Leon, go ahead.

192
00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:22.709
Danny Park: I'm sorry it has no real model to learn from. Yeah, yeah, it's literally like you, you just digitize data. You need to analyze the data first, like, you need business analysts to come in and look at the data and start making their associations right and start figuring out. Hey.

193
00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:29.529
Danny Park: what data sets rel relevant? Which is not what business problem do we have? You have to go through all the rigor before you start

194
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:33.129
Danny Park: treating AI as like a solution.

195
00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:36.410
Danny Park: right? So

196
00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:47.730
Danny Park: absolutely hit the nail on the head. And that's that's some of this, the pro. So I'll give like a actual chat. Gpt. Issue, right? I think we talked about before. I kind of bring it back is that

197
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:50.319
Danny Park: if your staff

198
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:58.529
Danny Park: or your organization has never really implemented technologies to do digitalization and going through the rigors to understand

199
00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:02.249
Danny Park: the purpose behind a particular tool

200
00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:07.170
Danny Park: that you bring in. Then how would they ever know

201
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:11.800
Danny Park: what or how to use? Chat? Gp, for example.

202
00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:14.350
Danny Park: right? Because

203
00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.950
Danny Park: Chat GPT. For it to be very useful for you

204
00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:26.729
Danny Park: you have. You had to be able to prompt it right? So anyone know, like anyone want to talk about what prompting means.

205
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:35.720
Danny Park: Anyone like when we say, Hey, we use chat. Gpt. they say you have to prompt it correctly.

206
00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:41.040
Li Zheng: Oh, you you give it like you give it a question right like that's why it happened.

207
00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:50.340
Danny Park: Great. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, it is. But let's let's get. Now, let's think like business analysts. Right? Let's think like, Mbas, right

208
00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:52.050
Danny Park: is.

209
00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:57.080
Danny Park: are all questions of equal value?

210
00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:16.289
Li Zheng: No, not really. You could. Yeah. Go ahead. Why sorry? Is the cloud blue? Right? And you could restructured the question be, why is the cloud

211
00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:18.310
Danny Park: exactly

212
00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:27.040
Danny Park: so? What they mean by prompt great Leonard Lee? Thank you for your contribution, because you guys are hitting nail on the head. So what prompting means is

213
00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:36.140
Danny Park: you'll have, since it's the way it learned. it's learning off very large

214
00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:42.079
Danny Park: data sets and layering in different types of algorithms and models of learning.

215
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:49.350
Danny Park: right, large language models unsupervised and supervised. And and and also it's using

216
00:25:49.470 --> 00:26:00.950
Danny Park: and not only nlp, but nlu, so natural language, understanding right? A a next. The next generation of Nlp tech. Right? So let's think about it.

217
00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:05.310
Danny Park: And let's use a human example right to understand what prompting means.

218
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:14.409
Danny Park: So let's say I am a I work I will. I work at Peterborough, so I work at Pwc. As I have an intern, so intern comes to me right?

219
00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:17.179
Danny Park: The intern is a intelligent system.

220
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:21.240
Danny Park: All humans are intelligent systems, however right

221
00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:29.729
Danny Park: the capacity or capability of our intelligence system. It depends on multiple factors.

222
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:32.750
Danny Park: Right? So that intern.

223
00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:38.369
Danny Park: If you were to say academically, let's say intern graduate from Harvard. Right? And

224
00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.710
Danny Park: I graduated from Baruch. Right?

225
00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:48.870
Danny Park: Academic knowledge wise we're equal. Yes, II said it. We're we're equal to Harvard. Goddammit. All right. We're we're equal.

226
00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.410
Danny Park: however, because my system

227
00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.810
Danny Park: meaning my brain

228
00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:59.269
Danny Park: right, that the the ultimate CPU and intelligence that exists on this planet.

229
00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:06.539
Danny Park: It's it has the capability to do more. Because I have actual wisdom.

230
00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:17.950
Danny Park: meaning context. You need context to take knowledge, turn it into wisdom. Right? So. But other people call it intuition, or whatever you want to call it.

231
00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:21.750
Danny Park: So there's gonna be a limitation to.

232
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:24.390
Danny Park: but the intern can understand.

233
00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:41.590
Danny Park: So if I were to tell the intern, hey, I need you to go research the tax code, alpha blah blah blah blah, and then do a regressive analysis on the data sets of the finance industry. Who takes, you know, Rick.

234
00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:42.890
Danny Park: Rick

235
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:48.350
Danny Park: credits and provide for me, which client should go after in proposals.

236
00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:54.099
Danny Park: right? The intern. So I just prompted the intern.

237
00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.769
Danny Park: Right? What is the intern going to do

238
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:05.869
Danny Park: anyone? It's obvious you guys just yell it like you. Just it's what's the intern going to do

239
00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:07.210
Aidan(Hun Seok) Choi: following TV?

240
00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:08.610
Leslie Vides: Follow your shoes.

241
00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:13.380
Danny Park: The Intro probably quit. It's not gonna understand.

242
00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:22.039
Danny Park: It's gonna go. What tax code, what? What cause? He's an intern, just new brand, new, just academic background has no understanding of anything else. Right?

243
00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:31.109
Danny Park: So the answers I'm going to get, or even its behavior, or his or her behavior is, is not going to be the exact, most efficient one.

244
00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:35.590
Danny Park: What if I pose that same question that prompt

245
00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:39.259
Danny Park: to a manager in my group.

246
00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:45.369
Danny Park: what would the response that I get? The response would be of

247
00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:53.130
Danny Park: of greater efficiency, higher quality, more actionable. Okay, so that's one example of how

248
00:28:53.210 --> 00:29:00.210
Danny Park: prompting a given system we have to understand the system before we know how to prompt.

249
00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:02.040
Danny Park: Now let's slip this.

250
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:07.639
Danny Park: Now let's flip the script. And the reason why I'm saying, because there are different types of

251
00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:09.570
Danny Park: Gen. AI out there. By the way.

252
00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.459
Danny Park: okay, not all are equal.

253
00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:14.680
Danny Park: So now let's flip the script.

254
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.020
Danny Park: Let's say that

255
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:19.719
Danny Park: I'm prompting.

256
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:28.919
Danny Park:  let's see a director, a director of product of of project management.

257
00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:32.120
and I'm not a. I have no idea

258
00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:39.310
Danny Park: what project management is. I'm actually here to learn from the director. Right? This human system.

259
00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:50.359
Danny Park: right? Pmp, acp, lean, sick background ton of experience like a lot in there, lot in her mind. She's got so much wisdom and knowledge. It's like it's all in there

260
00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:58.410
Danny Park: right, and I'm an I'm novice. I don't know what the hell I'm talking about. Right? And I go. And I actually need a project plan.

261
00:29:59.050 --> 00:29:59.780
Danny Park: Right?

262
00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:05.679
Danny Park: So I prompt this director and say, Hey, hey! Hey! Susan.

263
00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:08.899
Danny Park: can you give me a project plan

264
00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:16.059
Danny Park: for a tax deliverable due on the 20 third of March?

265
00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.910
Danny Park: What would that director say. as a response

266
00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:36.450
Leonard (Wess): to probably ask you, How do you want the deliverable? No, it would. It would ask you a bunch of other questions. Right? Cause to to this person

267
00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:49.810
Danny Park: with so much knowledge in project management is, gonna say, Hey, like, what do you like? Okay, you just gave me a date like, what is the requirements? Who are your team members who are your dependent stakeholders, who are so like?

268
00:30:52.460 --> 00:31:13.600
Danny Park: She will probably give me an answer, but because I prompt it as such a high novice way. She'll probably give me a equally high, level answer, because in her mind she's gonna go. Wow! That that question was so high level I don't know how to answer it. I want to be helpful. The only option I have right now is either ask another question, or I'm gonna provide an answer. That's so, general

269
00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:19.709
Danny Park: that hopefully, Danny can take something from there or have another question

270
00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:22.809
Danny Park: to get me to where I need to be

271
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:25.190
Danny Park: right.

272
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:32.730
Danny Park: So very inefficient way of prompting a very, very sophisticated AI tool or A AI system

273
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:34.529
Danny Park: on

274
00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:39.380
Danny Park: other scenario is, let's say, I'm equally as competent as

275
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.510
Danny Park: as Susan is in project management.

276
00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:48.940
Danny Park: Right? And I need. I'm gonna ask a question. And I ask her, Hey, Susan, I have a

277
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:52.189
Danny Park: I have an issue with my project management plan

278
00:31:52.440 --> 00:32:00.559
Danny Park: and the due dates, and 20 third, and the stakeholders are the international task practice, and they are combined with 4 multinationals.

279
00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:02.740
And I have a problem.

280
00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:12.440
Danny Park: With the knowledge area of integration management. I'll know exactly what tool to use to make sure that all my stakeholders are, are informed

281
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:18.809
Danny Park: as as closely as possible, so we could all work. They are seamlessly with handoffs.

282
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:22.559
Danny Park: How would Susan respond to that question

283
00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:35.110
Danny Park: right? She would give me a better specific answer. That's useful for me. Because I really told her within the context of my problem, I'm asking for a specific gap.

284
00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:39.740
Danny Park: And I referenced a knowledge group in the P. Mi. Handbook.

285
00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:52.000
Danny Park: a knowledge area asking which technique or tool do I use? Which process, group or tool do I use which a knowledge area knowledge area integration management to help my stakeholder stay aligned during the project.

286
00:32:53.860 --> 00:33:06.320
Danny Park: So then she's gonna give me she go? Boom! And then I'm going to trigger the exact place in her data set in her mind. And then she's gonna tell me her wisdom related to that specific thing.

287
00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.269
Danny Park: So I get their solution a lot faster.

288
00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.150
Danny Park: So that's prompting.

289
00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:17.400
Danny Park: I can. You guys still hear me?

290
00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:30.320
Danny Park: I thought, I just I lost my mic. So when we talk about prompting, we see how we we prompt in human life. Like we work, we prompt each other all the time.

291
00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:40.310
Danny Park: but we tend to speak past one another because we don't understand our own intelligence, like we don't understand our level of knowledge

292
00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:44.029
Danny Park: to where we are asking the right question at the right time.

293
00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:55.540
Danny Park: So even with Chat G, chat, Gp, that rule of prompting, it doesn't go away because we are building that system just like our human being is supposed to behave.

294
00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:07.030
Danny Park: Because that's all our technology systems. Our technology is supposed to mimic human behavior. We're trying to get it to become as close to human as possible. Better we talked about during our AI. Right?

295
00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:20.179
Danny Park: So when we have Chat Gp, let's say this client wants to, says, oh, I just digitized. I'm gonna build. Bring in chat. Gp, what do you think's gonna happen? The staff are, gonna go okay and gonna ask it

296
00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:25.690
Danny Park: highly general, unsophisticated, unuseful questions.

297
00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:30.830
Danny Park: And they're gonna get so frustrated. Then they're going to stop using tragedypt

298
00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:38.050
Danny Park: because they're like question. No, that's not what I want. Another question. That's not what I want. Another question. It's not what I want and like. Oh, this is useless.

299
00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:40.519
Danny Park: I'm just going to go to Google and copy and paste.

300
00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:48.720
Danny Park: or they're gonna go. Oh, that must be the right answer, based off my question, and then. or absorb it

301
00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:53.220
Danny Park: when the quality of the answer they get

302
00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:58.229
Danny Park: is equal to the quality of the answer provided

303
00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:10.569
Danny Park: so long. Story short, you still need people knowledgeable about the topic in your organization to be able to formulate a prompt the question that's gonna create the Gen. A. I's ability

304
00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:13.809
Danny Park: to get you exactly the wisdom that you're looking for.

305
00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:25.320
Danny Park: right. And that's slowly becoming the role. One of the key roles of a lead business analyst

306
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:27.740
Danny Park: is.

307
00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.980
Danny Park: how how do we bring in

308
00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:40.499
Danny Park: training mechanisms to get all of our staff on A, on a standard

309
00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:50.280
Danny Park: analytical sets and knowledge to where, if they're using chat Gp. they're using it efficiently and productively

310
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:53.229
Danny Park: and not mistaking

311
00:35:53.420 --> 00:36:05.860
Danny Park: the wrong answer for the right answer, and then give feedback to chat. Gpt that it's actually right like you given the right answer. So Chat Gp is as good as the responses it's provided. Meaning was I good, or was I bet?

312
00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:20.769
Danny Park: Right? So that's ingest what this automate in sum is what this automation continues trying to tell organizations like, Hey, you gotta figure out where you actually are

313
00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:33.669
Danny Park: as an organization like, have you only been doing excel work right? Did you bring in any technologies that are a little bit more advanced in excel. to train your staff

314
00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:43.810
Danny Park: on how to prompt meaning? If you, if you, if you begin to learn how systems behave against rules and code, you provide it at traditional code.

315
00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.620
Danny Park: Right? The logic.

316
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:53.560
Danny Park: Then you begin to understand how you're supposed to be giving or pro or or structuring your questions.

317
00:36:54.140 --> 00:37:00.840
Danny Park: Then, as your staff begins to get more knowledge and get a better understanding of how technology behaves

318
00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:06.260
Danny Park: with the human in the loop. Then you're able to train them on how to prompt

319
00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.700
Danny Park: these advanced tools.

320
00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:16.299
Danny Park: So just like we talked about in the very beginning, just because you have a technology in your organization. Does that mean you have the capability to use it

321
00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:33.150
Danny Park: right? And that's so again, like, when people. Wanna you know, when we talk about the business analyst, right? That's right here, what's happening right now. So let's say you're a business analyst role in your human capital

322
00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:34.730
Danny Park: function.

323
00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:47.280
Danny Park: Right? Right? I like, I said before, like everyone. And I reason why I'm using like different examples besides finance and accounting, because the role of business analyst is is pervasive. So if you're in the if you're in the human capital function

324
00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:56.120
Danny Park: for one of the main, the the one of many major consultants who are building out their their own chat. Gpt.

325
00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:03.850
Danny Park: you are analyzing where your current staff are when it comes to their knowledge area.

326
00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:13.640
Danny Park: Okay, so very, very important

327
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:19.480
Danny Park: topic of discussion for those who are working full time.

328
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:25.489
Danny Park: Right? So I'll stop here. Any any questions, any comments, any any feedback.

329
00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.260
Danny Park: Anyone want to share any stories?

330
00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:41.669
Erania Johnson (EJ): Oh, all good. Alright, no worries. Yeah. But I do think it is very interesting that you know.

331
00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:55.120
Erania Johnson (EJ): people that are using. AI are looking at it as a shortcut. But, like you said, you have to have the intelligence to make sure you're asking, or prompting AI to give you the actual results that you're looking for.

332
00:38:55.690 --> 00:39:03.309
Danny Park: No, absolutely. No, I'm I'm glad you brought that up and use the word shortcut. No, you're exactly right.

333
00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:14.360
Danny Park: like a lot of a lot of clients. When when Chat Gp first came out, they literally were saying, Oh, my God, this is a shortcut we could we could like, we could reduce headcount.

334
00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:16.809
Everyone who knew

335
00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:26.770
Danny Park: the importance of digitalization meaning the pros. Not only the technology, but the processes around using advanced tech

336
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:32.819
Danny Park: were like, no, the last thing you want is to reduce headcount

337
00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:39.730
Danny Park: cause. You have no idea where your knowledge sits in your organization. You might have a clue. But you really don't know.

338
00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:42.650
Danny Park: cause no one actually does that exercise

339
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:54.080
Danny Park: right? And that's what they hire consultants. But are we the most knowledgeable? Not really, sometimes most of my, but funny, not fun. Fact. Just real fact is.

340
00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:58.830
Danny Park: I would say, about half my engagements on the strategy, like any type of consulting, I did

341
00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.390
Danny Park: our conclusion.

342
00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:05.189
Danny Park: The the staff already got to that same conclusion.

343
00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:12.600
Danny Park: which is very which is, I was like, very like Whoa! Why, why is this happening. But the knowledge was there.

344
00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:19.830
Danny Park: But there was no analytic function to tell executives. You have knowledge

345
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:23.190
Danny Park: in your organization. You don't need to outsource it

346
00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:29.710
Danny Park: right. It's very. It was a very eye opening moment for me, like just the the

347
00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:39.490
Danny Park: how business analytics, how, if you have that function doesn't exist in certain departments, how you could actually make really, really wrong misjudgments.

348
00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:46.769
Danny Park: Alright, so great example it's and it's not a shortcut. So what what is? How is it. How is it related to everyone is in this, in this room.

349
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:49.469
Danny Park: that mass amount of opportunity.

350
00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:58.690
Danny Park: right? The business, analytical role. Not only would do that right meaning, prompting

351
00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:07.799
Danny Park: being in the loop of making a intelligent system even smarter. So as a business analytic function as humans are prompting it.

352
00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:14.459
Danny Park: responding to it. You would analyze the efficiency, effectiveness of the actual feedback given by the users.

353
00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:21.279
Danny Park: Right? It's not just for data science anymore, like, there's so many different roles for business analysts.

354
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:29.619
Danny Park: Anything anyone else, anyone else, wanna share any, maybe concerns they have around what AI means to their careers.

355
00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:51.759
Donald Rada: I just have a story, Professor. So, being a teacher, we're required to write our weekly lesson plans. and it's one of the heavy loads that we have to do. And because of how busy we get. I've actually been using Magic School AI to kind of like, Get me started with writing my lesson plans. And it really helps a lot

356
00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:58.230
Danny Park: awesome. But that's because you're a like. Your experience

357
00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:02.110
Danny Park: is prompting it the right way. So

358
00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:10.949
Danny Park: and II and I wanna kind of piggyback. What you just said and what Eugenia said before is. it's a shortcut, in a sense that

359
00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:19.779
Danny Park: if you have the right knowledge set or not right knowledge based in your organization. And you're letting them deploy.

360
00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.639
Danny Park: chat, chat, GPT. Or Gen. AI.

361
00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:30.629
Danny Park: Their area of expertise. Then you would definitely get quote unquote shortcuts. But we don't really call that shortcut. We call that

362
00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:32.480
Danny Park: enhance productivity.

363
00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:40.150
Danny Park: But let's say you would have someone who's not a teacher. Let's say, let's say they say you know what

364
00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:46.500
Danny Park: teachers are expensive, which is not true. I think teachers should get paid triple the amount of they get.

365
00:42:47.060 --> 00:43:01.129
Danny Park: But let's, I'm just hypothetical. Let's say, let's say, goes, our teachers are ex expensive. Let's outsource this. Let's let's give it to a team in Ukraine, and they say that Jennai experts who guys tell them, create us a curriculum like who would trust that curriculum

366
00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:09.780
Danny Park: right? Because a curriculum, especially in the United States, depending on geography and and jurisdiction you're in is very customized and specific.

367
00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:15.569
Danny Park: and then public versus private. And then where the funding comes from, and all this other stuff.

368
00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:23.300
Danny Park: right? What network you're in like, Cuny, like Cuny, is different than Sunni is, if and then Columbia.

369
00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:31.310
Danny Park: right? How they want their curriculums built. And what needs to be in the learning object is everything else right? So very fascinating.

370
00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:32.430
Danny Park: how

371
00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:37.990
Danny Park: fascinating, how much opportunity there is for people who want to get into

372
00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.200
Danny Park: digitalization?

373
00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:42.430
Danny Park: Right?

374
00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.320
Danny Park: So

375
00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:49.170
Danny Park: that's that any other ending questions or comments or stories people want to share?

376
00:43:50.810 --> 00:44:09.080
Anup Dey: Professor, I wanted to say something. Oh, go ahead. Yeah, no, you know, I was thinking that it should not be seen as a shortcut. I feel like, that's like completely wrong way of seeing this. I feel like it should be taken as like a like a tool. You know something that that helps us utilize

377
00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:34.069
Anup Dey: our resources better. I feel like saying that it's a shortcut is just under selling it. It's like, you know. Would you like your siri on your iphone, for example, Professor, when it first came out. Would you say that Cv is is is a shortcut? No, I think it's it's just a tool which is helping us do things in a more efficient and faster way 100. And

378
00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:44.220
Danny Park: I love that love that comment and your thought there, and I'll I'll actually use a a a real life example. I've been kind of using

379
00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:51.770
Danny Park: chat gpt as a tool for for from a career perspective. So the usual question I get

380
00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:58.770
Danny Park: from a lot of Mba students is, hey, Danny, like this is my experience. But I have.

381
00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:08.529
Danny Park: I want to go for this role like. am I like? Am I qualified, or am I competitive right? And then I was like.

382
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:21.390
Danny Park: what what tool can I? Because I get a lot of requests? Right? So I got like, what what tool can I use or meaning? How can I use Chat Gbt to to as a tool to help more students?

383
00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:24.779
Danny Park: So what I did was like, oh, you know what I was like. Hey! Send me a resume.

384
00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:26.360
Danny Park: send me a resume.

385
00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:34.320
Danny Park: and then I take the job description, and I tell Jack Gbt, hey, chat Gp! Read this resume. Read this in job description

386
00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:37.959
Danny Park: based on the resume and the job description.

387
00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:45.569
Danny Park: and all the other important considerations for this role within this industry. And I actually type in

388
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:51.020
Danny Park: whatever the job description leads to the role in this industry. provide the next

389
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:53.220
Danny Park: steps, for

390
00:45:53.700 --> 00:46:05.899
Danny Park: you know the person's name on their resume as to how they can fill that gap to get competitive. And you know what Chat Gp does. It gives me literally the step by step. What is things that that the the steps be just a guide.

391
00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:08.470
Danny Park: It's not, it's not, it's not accurate as a guide.

392
00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:24.490
Danny Park: and I just take that guide, and I meet with the student and just go through and go, hey, what's what's what's first, I look through chat. You could teach responses to see if, like, okay? Because of what chat Tp is not gonna add in, there is the the like, the availability of resources and time of the student.

393
00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:33.609
Danny Park: Right? So then, I look at it, and I go to the student, and we just kind of we gain plan and we go. Hey, what's reasonable? What's not reasonable? Or we just, you know, get creative with it

394
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:40.610
Danny Park: and brainstorm and pivot, and just come out with a you know. Next, you know a few next steps for the next 4 to 6 months

395
00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:44.600
Danny Park: and see how that goes. Cat. Tp is an amazing tool

396
00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:48.159
Danny Park: for all. And Mbas in my perspective.

397
00:46:49.530 --> 00:47:04.830
Danny Park: So that's that's another. That's a really good, real life example of how Chat Gpg can use be as a tool for for for to solve or to help solve for some short-term to to intermediate steps.

398
00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:10.170
Danny Park: Is everyone gonna go and try Gbt today and try it?

399
00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:32.720
Anup Dey: Now III would. I would actually suggest people just try it and see what see what happens. Right? I know, Professor, you know it's it's like fascinating that you mentioned this cause, like, you know, another professor of ours. She was telling me that, you know. Use chat. Gbt. Get accustomed to it, cause you know, at some point in life I feel like this is going to become

400
00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:36.829
Anup Dey: very important to everyone. But you know, as of right now.

401
00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:46.300
Anup Dey: tentbt is not the end product. It will not give you the end product, but it will give you some indication or guidelines as to what could be.

402
00:47:46.340 --> 00:48:00.340
Danny Park: Yup, the right answer, yeah. Yeah. A good solid initial approach to get us. To get us aligned on what we, what we should be doing, what we should be thinking about like, absolutely

403
00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:07.320
Danny Park: and it's definitely not a solution. It's a tool for sure, like all technologies. Just just so. F, before I go into

404
00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:10.720
Danny Park:  with the more hands up.

405
00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:13.169
Danny Park: I just want to make sure that we understand.

406
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:21.240
Danny Park: And this is a fact. It's not like a feeling like any you ask anyone in the tech industry. This is true. You'll hear from business people who are not tech, savvy.

407
00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:26.210
Danny Park: confuse it. Technology was never meant to be a

408
00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:29.210
Danny Park: solution. Technologies

409
00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:30.949
Danny Park: are meant to be tools

410
00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:35.390
Danny Park: anytime. You try to. You try to solution.

411
00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:41.700
Danny Park: Right? I mean, like, create, like, really like, say, like, I have a business problem of

412
00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:45.900
Danny Park: us not being efficient with data. And you say, excel is a solution.

413
00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:58.159
Danny Park: That's a big problem, because excel is not the solution. Because why? Like, we talked about just having technology is not good enough you need to bring in the capability. And how do you bring in the capability? You have to have a staff that's trained

414
00:48:59.110 --> 00:48:59.850
Danny Park: right?

415
00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:02.310
But I'm gonna get to the hands real quick

416
00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:28.770
Chenge Tsapayi: ch chat.

417
00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:36.349
Chenge Tsapayi: I wasn't asking it the right questions. And I got frustrated because it was giving me the wrong answers, yeah. So yeah, I didn't know how to ask.

418
00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:55.870
Chenge Tsapayi: You know, opm questions to give me the right answer. So I ended up giving up, because every time I told it it was wrong, it would regenerate a new answer that was also wrong. So I ended up like going around in circles and waiting time on it, cause I didn't know how to instruct it

419
00:49:55.900 --> 00:50:14.189
Danny Park: exactly. And then can you imagine how like you had enough wisdom to know that it was giving you wrong answers. How many people who don't know? I think that's the right answer, and actually execute on it? Right? Right? That's what's scary for businesses and for organizations that don't have a really strong business analytic function to check

420
00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:32.189
Danny Park: what these AI tools tools are informing us on Lee, go ahead. Yeah. So basically what I think of Shat Gp, as is like the next evolution of what Google used to be right? Because at this point Google is no longer. A search engine is just an advertising platform at this point.

421
00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:56.399
Li Zheng: So like you pretty much, it's the same like. Probably we add, we search up the same prompts as what we used to do, but instead of getting span with like 20 different ads on the first page for paid advertisers, and then reading through the documents itself, like from each of the websites. We just get a more direct answer. But the answers itself could be wrong cause it's like also pulling from the same sources. Yeah, and that's it. And then another great point is that

422
00:50:56.580 --> 00:51:04.519
Danny Park: data quality has to be involved. When we think about these AI tools. Right? So we know that chat Gpt.

423
00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:19.289
Danny Park: it's using lot of open source data to be trained on. Think about the Internet, like how much actual Bs is on that thing right? It's pulling from Wikipedia. For God's sake, right? And then what what happened in high school when you referenced Wikipedia.

424
00:51:19.530 --> 00:51:21.860
Danny Park: or even in college, you get a big red X,

425
00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:31.960
Danny Park: right? So we have to be very conscious of that, too. And that. And that's a business analytic. Again, that's another business analytic function like there, there will be the safeguards

426
00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:52.980
Danny Park: to what should be added to the organization's data life cycle. Because if your if if users are saying, Oh, this DNA information is good. And they added to, let's say, a data entry. Right? So then, that's gonna add, be, that's gonna be added to your data sets for everyone here who wants to pursue business analytics as a career.

427
00:51:53.020 --> 00:52:07.270
Danny Park: Right? So that means that it's going to that. It's going to be included in your data sets the data analytics function, part of your of your business analytic lifecycle. So it does definitely have a a might have a career impactful event

428
00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:18.330
Danny Park: for many people in the business analytics function because their users who are not BA's might be giving you bad data, and they don't even know it, cause they're relying too much on this AI stuff

429
00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:25.950
Danny Park: and thinking that oh, it's AI! It must be smarter than me when the when the first term in in in the tool is artificial.

430
00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:33.739
Danny Park: right? It's not real. It's artificial. You always have to check to see if it's actually healthy for you.

431
00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:50.469
michael amuev: Yeah. So I just kinda wanted to reiterate kind of what you said earlier and what Cheney said about asking it the right questions. I really learned to value that, especially when using artificial intelligence. Because it's not just the questions. It's also prompting Chad Gbt.

432
00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:57.099
michael amuev: and I really realized that when I did some research, you can assign it like specific roles to wear like a specific hat.

433
00:52:57.100 --> 00:53:20.989
michael amuev: And if you can give it more specific details, like, if you wanna ask it, how to learn how to give the code python. It gives you like a general instructions, but if you give it a timeline, you assign it as a role as to somebody who's has plenty of experience with it and really get to like specifics with the resources you wanna use whether you wanna watch videos read articles. If you wanna pay for instructions, or if you wanna free, if you can apply all that into the prompt

434
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:26.270
michael amuev: yeah, I learned how valuable it is to catering it to your specific needs and the questions you ask it.

435
00:53:26.350 --> 00:53:28.899
Danny Park: Great wow! And that's

436
00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:35.950
Danny Park: excellent. And that's gonna like, put the icing on the cake cause it relates to what I was just about to say.

437
00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:39.030
Danny Park: So what what this should teach us.

438
00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:41.590
Danny Park: and what Michael would, and everyone else saying is that

439
00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:49.100
Danny Park: we can't forget that

440
00:53:50.690 --> 00:54:11.989
Danny Park: human beings are intelligent systems, and we prompt each other all the time, too. So before an organization focus so much on learning how to prompt AI. It might make sense to really start focusing on how each of the organization team members are communicating with one another. And if they're prompting each other correctly. First.

441
00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:23.130
Danny Park: because you can't say that you have a knowledge gap where things are not working, when your own staff are confused because they're not communicating well, meaning. They're not prompting each other.

442
00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:25.389
Danny Park: Right? I'm not. And I'm not saying

443
00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:33.520
Danny Park: the like. The the you should only ask the one question the one perfect question that that's not what I'm talking about, I'm saying. During a meeting

444
00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:45.140
Danny Park: during a workshop during some collaboration. Is there actual value driven dialogue where people are are are running on like instead of like running on assumptions.

445
00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:49.010
Danny Park: They're actually running on a true understanding of one another.

446
00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:56.250
Danny Park: Right? And I'll give a really easy example what I mean, right? So the same intern right? And I tell this intern, hey.

447
00:54:56.350 --> 00:55:01.510
Danny Park: I want. Here's the paperwork I want you to file, and I want it done today.

448
00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:13.760
Danny Park: right? And the intern goes and and then is, does it? And it comes back to me at 6 Pm. And says, oh, I'm done right. And then I'm gonna go. Let's say I go wait.

449
00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:16.769
Danny Park: It's late. I needed it done earlier.

450
00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:19.499
Danny Park: right? What was what was a problem there.

451
00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:22.590
Danny Park: And whose fault was it?

452
00:55:25.570 --> 00:55:27.999
Danny Park: Anyone check? You go ahead.

453
00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:34.980
Chenge Tsapayi: You didn't tell the intern the timeframe. Yeah, specifics. Exactly. So. I prompted intern completely, incorrectly.

454
00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:46.170
Danny Park: But the intern didn't know enough to know. Oh, I should actually act because it's an intern like right? So interns like didn't know enough to say, Oh, today. But exactly what time do you need it?

455
00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:52.670
Danny Park: So like, that's like, how many that's such that happens all the time. How many times that happen with an organization

456
00:55:54.090 --> 00:56:00.440
Danny Park: all the time. So when the Executive sees things late in the Executive's mind, the executives thinking

457
00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:04.099
Danny Park: the executive's thinking, everyone's communicating. Well.

458
00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:10.380
Danny Park: so executive goes. This is late. Oh, must be something wrong with my knowledge like my my team. They're just not that swamp.

459
00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:15.030
Danny Park: Let me go. Hire some consultant. Let me go buy some AI tool.

460
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:27.710
Danny Park: So that's what we mean when we talk about not only digital literacy, but the readiness to bring in tools cause sometimes you just don't need it.

461
00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:32.860
Danny Park: cause we've been prompting everyone's wrong

462
00:56:34.070 --> 00:56:45.380
Danny Park: that extends to everything in life, right? Even our even our relationships. even making reservations at a freaking restaurant. right? So the big takeaway here is that

463
00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:54.330
Danny Park: if we're if, as BA's, we learn to ask the right questions at the right time to get a true understanding of what is needed

464
00:56:54.590 --> 00:56:58.960
Danny Park: that will accelerate our careers, because not many people actually prompt each other. Well.

465
00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:07.780
Danny Park: and you'll notice and just pay attention. Now. when you hear people who are very successful speak. you'll notice that their prompting is different.

466
00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:14.179
Danny Park: The prompt but prompting is precise and specific and very inspirational.

467
00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:19.409
Danny Park: And then this is someone who doesn't have that much experience. And it's the way they prompt.

468
00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:20.980
Danny Park: They're impatient.

469
00:57:22.010 --> 00:57:26.280
Danny Park: right? They lack details, and they run on assumptions

470
00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:34.459
Danny Park: so to be elevated in the organization. The way we prompt our teams.

471
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:36.200
Danny Park: It shows immediately.

472
00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:39.410
Danny Park: because not many people are doing. It

473
00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:42.209
Danny Park: sounds so obvious, but

474
00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:52.279
Danny Park: sometimes success just takes obvious things. Just do obvious things alright. Let's move on, cause I don't. Wanna I don't. Wanna. I don't wanna relive this slide deck

475
00:57:52.530 --> 00:57:53.930
Danny Park: for another week.

476
00:57:54.410 --> 00:57:57.349
Danny Park: But the rest of this stuff is pretty straightforward, right?

477
00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:07.449
Danny Park: And we could read it on your own time. I'm not gonna test on slides 13 and 17 at all right. But Slide 13 and 17 is saying, Hey.

478
00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:13.149
Danny Park: because prompting is so important. and learning how to prompt

479
00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:19.230
Danny Park: and business analytics is important. Cause. Imagine you're a business analytic person you just ask. So you know, you ask really bad questions.

480
00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:28.899
Danny Park: right? And basically getting bad responses. You, you're getting bad data. Right? So we have to. We have to treat a business analytic

481
00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:42.339
Danny Park: business problem as a project to bring some organization or rigor on around it. because to ask the to ask the right question. Right? We first have to understand the problem.

482
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:54.670
Danny Park: So to understand the business problem takes that prompting of the stakeholders. Right? Right? Ask, you know, to. So we could get to the actual, true understanding of what the business problem is.

483
00:58:54.790 --> 00:59:17.489
Danny Park: Then, once we understand what the business problem is and not just assumptions. The actual problem was, we spoken with people. We got down to specifics when someone says, Oh, I think and you go. Oh, wait. What do you mean by you think like, why, don't you know? Let me help you find out, and then you kinda dig deeper and don't run. Don't run on the First Level assumption that that a non Sme tells you

484
00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:24.390
Danny Park: right? So then, once you understand the problem, then you can start working on what the gaps are.

485
00:59:25.170 --> 00:59:32.479
Danny Park: then these gaps will turn into gathering the right requirements and looking at the additional factors.

486
00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:35.570
Danny Park: and then you execute the project

487
00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:39.500
Danny Park: right? So if we think about

488
00:59:39.850 --> 00:59:41.000
Danny Park: how

489
00:59:42.290 --> 00:59:53.429
Danny Park: how we work. Our minds work the same way. When you're when you're given a business problem, you you first start. You first start trying to frame it and guess specifically, yeah, what is the person actually talking about?

490
00:59:55.300 --> 01:00:00.229
Danny Park: Right? Just like how Chat Gp would? So it it does. It's the same mechanism, same process.

491
01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:04.990
Danny Park: Okay? And then when we talk about framing

492
01:00:07.410 --> 01:00:12.889
Danny Park: the problem right? It's all about just defining the objectives

493
01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:19.479
Danny Park: right? Asking again, like, I know I'm gonna keep repeating myself like you, you have to ask the right questions.

494
01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:23.119
Danny Park: Right? The who's the what? The when? The why.

495
01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:32.050
Danny Park: right? For example, when I gave that intern. You know the, the, the, the, the task right? I didn't say when

496
01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:36.089
Danny Park: it was incomplete. A problem statement.

497
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:41.330
Danny Park: a problem cannot be clear if there is no who, what, when, and why?

498
01:00:41.410 --> 01:00:56.539
Danny Park: I mean, that's obvious. Right? Like, just think about, though how many times in your for those who work full time. How many times do you work? And you don't really know who it's for. You don't know what you're really doing, cause you don't know who it's for. You don't. Sometimes you don't know when it's due.

499
01:00:57.020 --> 01:01:01.969
Danny Park: right? Meaning you might give, be given a deadline, but there might be some group out there that actually needs to earlier.

500
01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:07.080
Danny Park: right? And you don't know why you're like, why are you doing it.

501
01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:16.309
Danny Park: I mean, besides the paycheck, I mean, I talk about like, why are you actually doing it like so if you if you don't know who, what, when, why, you don't have a problem.

502
01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:25.389
Danny Park: So you shouldn't be approaching someone with a problem statement unless you can. No, you could answer, or you know these 4 things.

503
01:01:26.110 --> 01:01:29.509
Danny Park: and if you are on the receiving end of a problem statement.

504
01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:34.960
Danny Park: and you don't know who, what, when, where, and why you should be asking a prompt link for those type

505
01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:43.749
Danny Park: of questions. I mean prompting those questions to get the answers. because you truly can execute efficiently

506
01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:47.660
Danny Park: or effectively if you don't know these 4 things

507
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:53.220
Danny Park: right.

508
01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:58.300
Danny Park: and then stakeholders everything else as usual. Just project management stuff, right?

509
01:01:58.320 --> 01:01:59.330
And then

510
01:01:59.710 --> 01:02:05.490
Danny Park: the last 4 4 slides here is just the different types of

511
01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:22.649
Danny Park: and you know the analytic types. And we, we would have talked about this in a common early slides. Right? This is descriptive analytics, diagnostic analytics, predictive analytics. These are all the statistic things. But as a business analyst a business analyst skill set.

512
01:02:23.770 --> 01:02:30.239
Danny Park: We have to have a good understanding of all the different types of analytic methods and techniques.

513
01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:46.569
Danny Park: Alright, that's about it for for today. Kind of conclude this slide, we went over kind of stress, the importance of prompting and everything else and digitization digitalization. Anyone have any any other stories or comments they want to share?

514
01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:50.639
Li Zheng: Professor, I was a little bit late. But did you talk about the midterm

515
01:02:50.770 --> 01:03:20.159
Li Zheng: or anything? Oh, yeah, yeah, II said, I'm not two-thirds done. I'm getting. I'm you know. II got some additional one hundred's and high 90 S. Trend is looking very well, and hoping that trend continues for the last one third I'm not sure if blackboard was able to get my submission because I never received the email from them. So I sent you no great question. I actually started with this. If I didn't get your exam. If I if I didn't get your exam by the due date, you'd already had an email from.

516
01:03:20.590 --> 01:03:25.429
Danny Park: So no, everyone I got everyone's exam. So no, you're welcome, Yup

517
01:03:25.850 --> 01:03:27.210
Danny Park: at the end.

518
01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:33.490
Dian Chen: Hi, Professor! So I was looking at the course schedule with a new updates.

519
01:03:33.570 --> 01:03:50.259
Dian Chen: You are going to be one of the host, or or the case study that's going on, or or challenge. Do we have to attend that in person or no? No, no, we'll the great question. We'll have a link. So once, once, Justin, Justin, m

520
01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:57.779
Danny Park: gets me the zoom link, I'll post it on blackboard and make an announcement. So you guys just just log onto the zoom and just listen in.

521
01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:02.400
Danny Park: and then I'll have the deliverable

522
01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:12.400
Danny Park: up on blackboard by then, too. So you know, for those who attend, you know you just, you know, finish the deliverable. It will be very quick, not too much

523
01:04:12.730 --> 01:04:19.099
Danny Park: involved, but you would have to be there, obviously to to be able to do the deliverable. And you'll get

524
01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:24.040
Danny Park: 10 points. I think I said. 10 points right, I think 10 points added to your final grade.

525
01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.339
Dian Chen: Awesome. Thank you. You're welcome

526
01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:34.410
Leonard (Wess): 2 points, Professor. one. I feel like

527
01:04:34.650 --> 01:04:38.900
Leonard (Wess): AI is not only restructuring

528
01:04:39.130 --> 01:04:45.849
Leonard (Wess): like the music and entertainment business. but it's kind of destroying it as well.

529
01:04:45.950 --> 01:05:04.310
Leonard (Wess): For the people who don't use it the proper way, so like you can hear like a famous artist like a 2 Poc song. Oh, my God, yeah. But you could hear that artist like his song rap by artists that we don't know right?

530
01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:15.820
Leonard (Wess): Or like, you know, artists that we don't know. Write a song and put it into pots. Voice vice versa. Oh, you're saying it? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my God!

531
01:05:15.970 --> 01:05:38.140
Leonard (Wess): Did anyone know what beyonce did?

532
01:05:38.590 --> 01:05:45.710
Danny Park: She trademarked herself, her voice and everything else? That's what I heard. So where anytime you any

533
01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:51.180
Danny Park: entity wants to use her voice or her likeness in any AI model, she gets a cut.

534
01:05:51.320 --> 01:06:00.580
Leonard (Wess): How do you do that trade? Yeah, I gotta know. I remember hearing that I gotta. I gotta research it. Yeah, yeah, definitely. I remember someone's cause.

535
01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:06.030
Danny Park: I remember that being brought up in one of the the one of the AI

536
01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:09.689
Danny Park: like I went to some AI like conference.

537
01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:18.930
Danny Park: It didn't bring it back article as you did, but it was like the same concept of like, it's gonna destroy some industries because it's gonna like it's it's gonna dilute

538
01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:21.969
Danny Park: like, like, for example, Michael Jackson has a state

539
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:28.530
Danny Park: and like his his. IP. Like that's generating wealth for his family and future.

540
01:06:28.970 --> 01:06:36.409
Danny Park: But that that's because you're you could like Michael Jackson, Michael Jackson like that's but if you can replicate that artificially.

541
01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:42.999
Danny Park: and you assign lootings. Yeah. Yeah. And then you could argue that. Oh, it's not him. It's this tech.

542
01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:56.759
Danny Park: We could make money. So then he, yeah, he would lose. Yeah, it's a it's a crazy, it's a it's a crazy, freaking world. It's a great, it's a it's a anyone see that new Chinese ad where the person who's doing the

543
01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:02.300
Danny Park: I think she's actually doing makeup tutorial. complete. AI

544
01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:05.060
Leonard (Wess): complete a I.

545
01:07:06.850 --> 01:07:12.990
Danny Park: It's crazy. It's crazy, it's it's it's like. So even like in the future, social media personalities.

546
01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:29.740
Danny Park: right? What would anyone have to fund a human to be a social media personality. You have all of the human. Yeah. So so, Meta. Oh, my God, we might go with over time. Hold! Let me stop the recording. And anyone who wants to hop off can hop off. But I just cause I this I'm about to get into like.

547
01:07:30.510 --> 01:07:33.100
Danny Park: I'm really fascinated. Let me just stop this real quick.
