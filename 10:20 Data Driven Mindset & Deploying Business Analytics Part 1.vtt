1
00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.420
Danny Park: Alright. So today's session is about

2
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:20.279
Danny Park: the digital mindset. Okay, it's kind of bringing us G bringing us back after our first exam, right? We're kind of getting getting an understanding of what business analytics is, what, what, why, we have to marry the business knowledge and experience with the data.

3
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:31.640
Danny Park: to be able to analyze it correctly, right? Because if you don't, if you don't understand your business, how do you know which data right? How do you know what data quality is. If you don't know what your business is.

4
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:48.430
Danny Park: and if you don't know what your data quality is, meaning is your data complete? How do you know which data analytical method to bring? Cause? There's several right? There's there's in in categories, there's predictive, there's descriptive, there's. And within those categories that all, there are multiple other techniques to bring.

5
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.559
Danny Park: So as a business analyst, that's what makes us

6
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.160
Danny Park: make a lot of money.

7
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:03.750
Danny Park: because we're so knowledgeable that when we see a business problem, we could decompose it down and understand how to actually solution it.

8
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.790
Danny Park: Okay.

9
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.290
Danny Park: alright. So let's take a step back. So

10
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.300
Danny Park: what is business analytics

11
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.190
Danny Park: trying to answer. And it's trying to answer 3 3 main questions. Right?

12
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.190
Danny Park: The first question is, as always, is, what's happening right now in our business

13
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.830
Danny Park: right

14
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:38.889
Danny Park: then, after we find out what's happening right now in our business. what we want to do is we wanna know what's gonna happen next.

15
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:48.729
Danny Park: right? And after we know what's gonna happen next, or we have some idea what's about gonna happen next. Then we have to find out

16
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.560
Danny Park: or figure out what should we do

17
00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:00.970
Danny Park: right? So business analytics is the culmination of the current state, the transformative state.

18
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.100
and the future state.

19
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.519
Danny Park: So in each phase of the business Analytical life cycle.

20
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:18.260
Danny Park: right? Which includes the data of life cycle which includes business analysis such as stakeholder market research. All these things right.

21
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.169
Danny Park: we have to build toward

22
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.039
Danny Park: our actual action steps. Meaning, what should we do so initially when we're asking what we're going to do right now.

23
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:37.490
Danny Park: right at the business analysis layer. Remember, business analytics is made up of 2 components, business analysis and data analytics.

24
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.969
Danny Park: So when we try to answer what's happening right now, for example, right?

25
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.109
Danny Park: Usually, we look at the financial statements

26
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.699
Danny Park: right? We look at a company's 10 K or the operating results.

27
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.959
Danny Park: And then we apply business analysis

28
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.050
Danny Park: to understand, hey, why do we have these budget variances?

29
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.079
Danny Park: Right? We said, we're gonna make 40 million dollars this upcoming year.

30
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.570
Danny Park: But our actuals right now we're on pace to only make 10 million.

31
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.810
Danny Park: Right?

32
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:24.909
Danny Park: So you're analyzing the health of the business. No real data analytics. Yet you just just looking at the numbers. Right? You're not analyzing. Just you're doing analysis. You're saying, Okay, what's going on right now? There's some problem.

33
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.809
Danny Park: We don't look that healthy

34
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:42.519
Danny Park: right? And in this example, you're in looking at the Kpis. Right? Your Kpis are your financial state to key performance indicators. Then, after you figure out like, Hey, right now doesn't look so good. Then you start doing some data analytics to get specifically

35
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.210
Danny Park: into. Hey?

36
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:53.250
Danny Park: Let's do some descriptive analytics to tell the story to executives on, hey? This is where we are right now.

37
00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.479
Danny Park: Right? So then, you're gonna have the answers

38
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.410
Danny Park: right? So you have the business analysis layer who looks at the Kpis.

39
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:12.259
Danny Park: Then you figure out which Kpis are the most variants. So you know, you have a target area. Right? You have, like, you know, you have clues as to where to look.

40
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:22.149
Danny Park: Then you apply data, analytics. And within the world of data analytics, you're applying descriptive analytics and that based on your the business

41
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.830
Danny Park: problem or the industry within descriptive analytics. You're you're using different techniques

42
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.810
Danny Park: to get answers

43
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.780
Danny Park: after you get those answers right? You, the executives will ask you

44
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:52.860
Danny Park: as lead BA's for those who are going to graduate with graduate with A. A. A. Mba and Mba. Track as a lead BA. For your group or your functioning department. The executive who runs, that department will say, Okay, what's going to happen next?

45
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.479
Danny Park: Based on our current state of what's happening right now? What are the

46
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.740
Danny Park: more? What are the probable things that may happen

47
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:12.710
Danny Park: right? So then, you take those answers you got from descriptive analytics. Then you apply the next level business analysis layer, which in this ex instance would be the market Kpis, right? And, for example, if your company

48
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.000
Danny Park: has.

49
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.180
Danny Park: you know, had financial results where it said they made 10 million dollars.

50
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:36.310
Danny Park: Right? So how do you know? Really, if you did, good or bad, right, you had a goal of 40 million. But what if the 40 million was too much of a long shot. Right? So you know, the common sense thing is to go look at the market and say, Okay, based on our competitors who are in our niche in our industry.

51
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.200
Danny Park: What were their results?

52
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:52.529
Danny Park: Right? Let's see right. Some made 20 million, some made less than us. So you you just do some market research and gather those Kpis. Then, looking based on all the the data points you you've identified that you need from the market

53
00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:02.470
Danny Park: and then overlaying that with the data points of your own internal company. you would then start applying some predictive analytics

54
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:12.950
Danny Park: to answer the question, what's going to happen next. Next? Right? So you give the executive 3 or 4, 5 possible events

55
00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:25.610
Danny Park: based on where you are today and other factors in industry, and what the comparison competitors are doing. Then from that predictive predictive analytics, you get the next set of answers.

56
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.849
Danny Park: Right? Then, with those answers, the Executive is going to ask you.

57
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:36.319
Danny Park: okay, we have 305, where? 6, you, you tell me these 4, 5, 6 things are gonna happen

58
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.020
Danny Park: you tell us

59
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.270
Danny Park: which one should we actually execute.

60
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:58.890
Danny Park: Right then, what what you do is you start looking in your organizational partners, capabilities. You go. Okay. We know what we know. These 5 or 6 things might happen in the in in the market.

61
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.030
Danny Park: so that so

62
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:13.779
Danny Park: to know which one to take advantage of, we have to know what our capabilities are as an organization and what our partners capabilities are, because we need to solution this thing. Then, after you gather those data points

63
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:21.590
Danny Park: you bring, or you overlay that on your predictive and descriptive analytics. And then you run prescriptive analytics.

64
00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.929
Danny Park: meaning based on all of our analytics and analysis

65
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.919
Danny Park: out of all these oldies

66
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.519
Danny Park: possible events we should be doing these activities.

67
00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:42.630
Danny Park: cause these activities, will mitigate these bad events and then help us take advantage of these good events.

68
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.769
Danny Park: and that is what we call a strategy and plan.

69
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:55.639
Danny Park: So that's why I was reason why I was stating early. I wanted to open up with those who want to be business analytics.

70
00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.570
Danny Park: because usually real business analytics leads to strategy.

71
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.899
Danny Park: Now we know why or how.

72
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:14.210
Danny Park: Right. So if you look at the the life cycle of business analytics as we should know it, not the bordered down version, you see an industry, but from people who don't know what they're talking about

73
00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:31.260
Danny Park: the real life cycle business analytics is this is this complex interchange between the business analysis layer and the data analytics, analytics layer. And you're going through it. But every time you go through it all the things we talked about so far we have to keep that in mind. For example.

74
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:46.369
Danny Park: you have every step step of the way your your answers are building. They're building blocks. So let's say. your data quality here. And what's happening now is bad.

75
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:54.270
Danny Park: For example, let's say you work for a company where you're not tracking data. You're not tracking a transaction. You're not tracking any metadata. You don't know what's really going on.

76
00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:08.950
Danny Park: And let's say you apply your business analysis to that chaos of no one knows who owns what, no one knows what transactions were were happening. No one knows what the dates are. Things are delayed.

77
00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:12.389
Danny Park: And then you gather the data from that business analysis.

78
00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.130
Danny Park: How can you even start doing descriptive analytics?

79
00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:22.450
Danny Park: Right? Because if your data quality is bad. what you're describing is also bad.

80
00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:30.369
Danny Park: So how would you? Well, how can you ever layer on predictive and in prescriptive analytics. When you're initially your descriptive

81
00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.189
Danny Park: right? You don't even know who you are.

82
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.750
Danny Park: Right. So as business analysts.

83
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:53.040
Danny Park: as we build our discipline in the business and data layer. We also have to continue to be, be, be be very mindful of data, quality data, infrastructure, data strategy. All those things.

84
00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.580
Danny Park: Okay? And ultimately.

85
00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.390
Danny Park: what all that sums up to

86
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:11.640
Danny Park: is data quality assurance. So for those who have seen that jive title be thrown around that you see data quality assurance. That's what that function does. That function

87
00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:19.670
Danny Park: is looking at each layer of the business analytic each cycle or each phase of the business analytical life cycle

88
00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:29.059
Danny Park: and just ensuring that the data is of good quality to be able to do good. Descriptive analytics get us good answers.

89
00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:38.360
Danny Park: They layer on more data to be able to make sure that we have good data here to give us good predictive analytics, and so on and so forth.

90
00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:45.849
Danny Park: Right? All business analysts have to have eye toward data quality assurance.

91
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:49.760
Danny Park: right? And that's why.

92
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:55.709
Danny Park: when you see the big tech companies, you'll see the term technical business analyst.

93
00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:59.460
a technical business analyst does not code a program.

94
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:12.369
Danny Park: That person knows enough about technology systems to understand how to audit the data quality coming out of those systems. Because when we get to when we talk about how you know when we want to answer what's happening right now?

95
00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:26.339
Danny Park: Right? That's the quality of that answer depends on how quality your technology systems are producing its data and tracking things. Right? In other words, the information system

96
00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:30.939
Danny Park: components not only the technology but also the people.

97
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:36.729
Danny Park: the data and the process. Because if you think about each layer, each layer here.

98
00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:51.219
Danny Park: right to build that financial result, the financial results are a culmination of all the data processing, the all the data processes, technologies and and kpis within the own segments and how they feed each other.

99
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.589
Danny Park: It's a very important concept. But many.

100
00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.449
Danny Park: you know. Not many's some professionals

101
00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:16.039
Danny Park: who don't have an understanding of business analytics is they miss. They dropped the ball so many times because they're only always focused on what? Just the data they want to go too quick at the analyzing data

102
00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:19.569
Danny Park: when they have no understanding which one to apply.

103
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:25.489
Danny Park: I've been in. I've been on client interactions with their supposed BA's.

104
00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:31.010
Danny Park: And I would see prescriptive analytic techniques applied at what's what's gonna happen next.

105
00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.459
Danny Park: Just cause their analyst had no idea.

106
00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:41.850
Danny Park: Right? They're in that. They weren't. They weren't that good and understand the data analytics side.

107
00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:46.940
Danny Park: right? They understood the business problem.

108
00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:58.560
Danny Park: But they are applying the wrong analytic techniques. And there are other clients where I've seen the vice versa, right? Really good analytics. but just really bad business analysis.

109
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:04.510
Danny Park: Alright.

110
00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:13.689
Danny Park: So the question would be, Well, Danny, like My God, that is like, that's so much to handle. So what you're essentially saying is.

111
00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:21.289
Danny Park: we need good quality data. But the good quality data is a result of every single person in our organization

112
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:30.739
Danny Park: having an understanding of the impact that their business decisions and the resulting data has on the overall strategy of the firm.

113
00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:40.809
Danny Park: Because as business analysts. the quality of our strategy and plan that we kick out is, you know, you guys know, bad input bad output.

114
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:49.039
Danny Park: Our, the strength of our strategy is really based on how good our inputs are from the very beginning of our of our business analytic life cycle.

115
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:52.970
Danny Park: So what do firms have in place

116
00:13:53.680 --> 00:14:01.180
Danny Park: to help to help manage that right? Because it's it's a big task, and it's not a one fit solution.

117
00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:07.779
Danny Park: So what most organizations come up have come out with right? Is this concept called the digital mindset

118
00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:18.410
Danny Park: alright. Anyone anyone work anyone who's working full time. Has has anyone gone through a digital mindset module or workshop?

119
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:26.430
Danny Park: No one? Don't be shy if you have.

120
00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.650
Danny Park: Is this for how many. Here is the first time you're hearing the term digital mindset.

121
00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:40.849
Harini: I mean in in colleges, they say numerical

122
00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.830
Harini: what they call it numerical.

123
00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:49.250
Harini:  you know, like numerical literacy, you know.

124
00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:57.600
Danny Park: Oh, right? Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, like, digital liters. Yeah, yeah. Same same concept, same concept. But like the digital mindset.

125
00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:08.800
Danny Park: like like he, you know, especially in the Big 4 or the consultant sees there's like like training role maps around digital mindset. So digital mindset, what is it?

126
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:17.590
Danny Park: It's a personal capability. I'll just read off the slide just for a second, because it's such a good definition of it, right? Is a personal capability. Aware of thinking

127
00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:20.670
Danny Park: that enables an individual to imagine better

128
00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:24.880
Danny Park: technology enabled ways of getting things done

129
00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:33.020
Danny Park: right? It's using data technology to streamline. Like all this, you know, things that we talk about. Efficiency, streamlining workflows, innovating, improve existing solutions.

130
00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:35.820
Danny Park: Blah, blah, blah, blah blah. So what what is this saying?

131
00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:38.950
Danny Park: What what this is saying is that

132
00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:46.949
Danny Park: you don't in every level of the organization. If you don't have people in the, in, under the the behavior

133
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:51.410
Danny Park: of understanding how everything they do in the organization

134
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:54.029
Danny Park: can be digitized

135
00:15:54.710 --> 00:16:06.940
Danny Park: right? And I don't know if we talked about this in this course, because III just do too many speakings and and to teach too many courses. I don't know exactly, but I know if you took my Mc. Course I've I've said this right.

136
00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:08.020
Danny Park: Is that.

137
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:12.299
Danny Park: Think about all the meetings that you guys have right

138
00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:16.600
Danny Park: of all the meetings that you have. how much knowledge

139
00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:21.849
Danny Park: and information spread across teams. But none of that is ever digitized

140
00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:24.870
Danny Park: right? No one puts it into a digital format.

141
00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:36.880
Danny Park: So if you, if you're not turning knowledge and information in the digital format. that means that you're missing that knowledge information in your initial data set.

142
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.900
Danny Park: So if you're missing that knowledge, knowledge, information and initial data set.

143
00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.260
Danny Park: how can you descriptive analytics

144
00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:57.769
Danny Park: be good when you don't have the complete data cause. No one knew enough to actually apply the digital mindset and find a way to digitize that data.

145
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.810
Danny Park: Right. So where is the policy that says, if you're on a

146
00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:07.699
Danny Park: ethical or execution workshop.

147
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:13.749
Danny Park: that you must record those sessions, and when you record those sessions, turn the script on.

148
00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:31.170
Danny Park: So when you turn the script on, and a key part or key knowledge is shared within the script, or when you're working, you say, everyone stop for digitization purposes. We will restate this knowledge and you restate it. So teams has it in script.

149
00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:33.940
Danny Park: in digital format.

150
00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:39.339
Danny Park: So then you could train your natural language processing. Now we call it Gen. A. I.

151
00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.070
Danny Park: That knowledge set

152
00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:45.789
Danny Park: how many organizations are thinking that way? Cause I know they're

153
00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:51.939
Danny Park: we are. and I know our competitors. Some of our competitors are. and it's on my client side.

154
00:17:53.950 --> 00:18:05.879
Danny Park: So in a nutshell, that's what digital mindset is saying, digital mindset is saying is, Hey, is your organization. Understand that everything they do need to be digitized because in the world, right now, in our world of the Information age

155
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.819
Danny Park: that all of our businesses are going to be impacted.

156
00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:15.069
Danny Park: based on the strength and quality of our AI mechanism.

157
00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:24.910
Danny Park: So if we can't, if we don't have captured all of our internal knowledge which creates a competitive advantage

158
00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.440
Danny Park: in a digital way. How can our

159
00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:32.549
Danny Park: subsequent AI platforms be any good?

160
00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.940
Danny Park: And Italia go ahead.

161
00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:43.110
Natallia’s iPhone: Yeah, I was gonna say that. I guess for bigger, larger organizations, it becomes a very.

162
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:45.080
Natallia’s iPhone: very limited

163
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:53.549
Natallia’s iPhone: option to digitize because it involves a lot of resources, and everyone has been cutting their expenses, not really

164
00:18:53.910 --> 00:19:05.649
Natallia’s iPhone: increasing them. And of course you have to keep in mind that maybe you have to take a step back and see it in the long run. It's gonna save money. But everyone's thinking like, perfect. Right?

165
00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:13.450
Danny Park: Yeah, yeah, no, that's a that's a that's a really good point. Right? There's some organizations who don't prioritize

166
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:18.089
Danny Park: data as a possible revenue stream.

167
00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:28.510
Danny Park: Right? So in that sense they would view the approach of digital mindset as being a cost center rather than an innovation center.

168
00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:37.979
Danny Park: Right? So. But that's something that that as business analysts, right people who understand the both the business data side. We have to understand that this AI stuff is not gonna go away

169
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:41.719
Danny Park: right? So if this AI stuff is not going to go away.

170
00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:49.909
Danny Park: The is capturing additional information or or in digital format. Is that actually a cost? Because in the future

171
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:57.310
Danny Park: lot of companies are gonna want to buy data just to make their AI capability stronger.

172
00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:07.140
Danny Park: Right? So let's think about major consultancy. Let's let's think I let's think of not to be biased for Big 4. Let's think of someone else. Let's think of Mckinsey.

173
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:20.760
Danny Park: let's say one day. So, Mackenzie, you know, it's viewed as a bright, the brightest right, like everyone's an ivy League and blah blah blah right, whatever whatever they want to call themselves. Right? Let's assume that they did bright brightest, brightest, and brightest. What if they today they're working on

174
00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:24.210
Danny Park: capturing that knowledge digitally.

175
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:28.160
Danny Park: and their future strategy is not to actually consult.

176
00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:33.979
Danny Park: but to sell that knowledge and digital format to other consultancy, so they can consult.

177
00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:37.729
Danny Park: How much scale did they just create?

178
00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:44.980
Danny Park: So now now, Mckenzie, as a brand is in every consultancy.

179
00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:50.819
Danny Park: so as business analysts.

180
00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:55.190
Danny Park: When we combine business and data, we are future looking.

181
00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:05.289
Danny Park: You see, here in this line. And this is the reason why I wanted to bring this up and it this applies to everyone's project. We are future looking

182
00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:14.240
Danny Park: as Mbas. especially in a top 50 program like Baruch. We must be future looking.

183
00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:20.680
Danny Park: Because if you're not feature looking, what's the point of having an Mba Lena? Go ahead.

184
00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:33.089
Danny Park: Yeah, Professor, would that be definition of economies of scale? The way they put that in Yup, it is completely scaled. It they're they're saying, you know what we're gonna take our our core competency.

185
00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:42.729
Danny Park: So Mckenzie's brand. Their core. Competency is is when you look. When you think about Mackenzie, you think of them as like the the like. The the Einsteins of the consulting world

186
00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:44.500
Danny Park: that's initial div brand.

187
00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:50.709
Danny Park: So if you know, that's the that's your brand. And and then everyone's trying to get to your level of intelligence.

188
00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:58.169
Danny Park: Why would you ever at the at the point of at the point of AI models? Why would you say? No, we're going to hold this

189
00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.540
Danny Park: just for ourselves? Because

190
00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:08.200
Danny Park: and like practically because, like you said, you can't serve every client. You don't have enough people.

191
00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:12.339
Danny Park: But who can? The actual consulting industry can.

192
00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:14.709
Danny Park: So you're like, you know what?

193
00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:20.769
Danny Park: Hey? Consulting industry? We're gonna back out from actually serving clients individually.

194
00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:26.350
Danny Park: But we're going to sell you our knowledge that you can use to build your a I mechanism

195
00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.239
Danny Park: that I know all of you are building.

196
00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:32.900
Danny Park: So here here it is, but pay us a premium

197
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:36.090
Danny Park: right

198
00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.830
Danny Park: to me. That's unbelievable cause. Then you don't need a headcount. You just need systems.

199
00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.209
Danny Park: Data is forever learning.

200
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:54.009
Danny Park: right knowledge is forever gathered. You could you could do a feedback loop where, when there, you're, you're these consultants you sell to. As they learn more, they have to feed you back data.

201
00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.570
Danny Park: Right? So that's that's

202
00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:00.389
strategic thinking.

203
00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:09.360
Danny Park: By applying the business side of where Mckinsey, for example, sits right? They sit in the consulting world. That's their business model.

204
00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:16.149
Danny Park: And then what do they offer from a data perspective or analytic perspective. Then you package it up.

205
00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:24.029
Danny Park: right? So it's called data. You know, it's it's it's been happening for years. Data monetization. But now we're at the next level.

206
00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:38.389
Danny Park: right? So digital mindset. So if you now you see how, if you didn't come with a digital mindset first, how Mackenzie would never, but never think about doing that. By the way, I don't work for Mckinsey. I don't know anyone there. If I'm at Mckinsey, that's what I'll be thinking.

207
00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:41.500
Danny Park: cause I'm applying my digital mindset

208
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:47.019
Danny Park: right now again. Not all brands can do that like

209
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:53.509
Danny Park: like, I don't know. Pick some pick, some regional consulting firm like that's not their brand.

210
00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:59.270
Danny Park: but they sure will buy Mckinsey, though if Mckinsey ever offered a data set

211
00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:03.790
Danny Park: right, they probably pay big bucks for it, too.

212
00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:10.149
Danny Park: So the strength of the digital mind said, I hope I hope it came clear

213
00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:15.130
Danny Park: how once you understand what this means, you become future looking

214
00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:25.869
Danny Park: right? So how do you get to? How do you become like digital mindset like, how do you like, hey? Like? How do I like? How do? Where do I get this thing, how do I get it? Right?

215
00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.799
Danny Park: And that's this term. I know everyone heard

216
00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:40.770
Danny Park: like I mean, not everyone. Most people heard more often, digital mindset digital literacy. So what's digital literacy? So digital literacy is actually using tools.

217
00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:44.609
Danny Park: So practicing creating things digitally

218
00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.980
Danny Park: right. And you see how it starts with just access

219
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:57.209
Danny Park: right? Giving your employees the tools like Uipath, like alter X, like word, like Powerpoint.

220
00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:58.630
Danny Park: write Google suite.

221
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.049
Danny Park: You know, there's some companies that are still on paper.

222
00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:09.219
Danny Park: I just dropped off. My, so I have a you know, my dog, III when it rains I drop it off at daycare

223
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:15.810
Danny Park: because I can't walk, and I can't play with the outside, so I don't want to do boards. I drop it off at daycare, and it plays with other dogs. When I go there.

224
00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:17.360
Danny Park: I'm filling out paperwork.

225
00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.390
Danny Park: They're not digitizing anything.

226
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.169
Danny Park: So because they don't have access to it. So it starts with access

227
00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:29.099
Danny Park: right then, after you give people the tool

228
00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.589
Danny Park: you teach them how to use it

229
00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.549
Danny Park: by use it. I'm talking about like

230
00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:46.559
Danny Park: like actually using it right? Not excel. And you have excel just to punch numbers and sales and do some functions and plus functions I'll talk about. Teach him how to do. V lookup h lookups. Write some basic Dva code

231
00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:52.629
Danny Park: cause if you don't teach them how to actually use the tool for what it's built for.

232
00:25:53.160 --> 00:26:01.640
Danny Park: how can they ever understand the business purpose for having that tool in the first place. for those who you excel at work. Do you understand why you have excel?

233
00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:04.340
Danny Park: Besides, to punch numbers?

234
00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:06.910
Danny Park: Anyone have any idea?

235
00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:16.579
Danny Park: It's a yeah go ahead.

236
00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:32.900
Natallia’s iPhone: I was, gonna say, yeah, I was. I was gonna say that they're there's also a side effect like a negative side of digitalizing everything because the Co. The customer is gonna lose the customer experience that they use to a personal touch.

237
00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:42.999
Natallia’s iPhone: If you digitalize everything like taking a very simple example of going to the grocery store. I purposely avoid all these self service registers

238
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:44.340
Natallia’s iPhone: because it just

239
00:26:44.550 --> 00:27:03.879
Natallia’s iPhone: like I am purchasing, and I'm also doing their job. So not all industries are gonna want to cut out

240
00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:11.040
Danny Park: the human element of it. Absolutely 100%. Sure, I mean, 100% accurate. What you provided was a great

241
00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:15.640
Danny Park: great great great feedback right?

242
00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:19.819
Danny Park:  But on. So what's interesting is

243
00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:21.759
Danny Park: so you know. So that

244
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:28.609
Danny Park: androids right? So reason why they're building androids is to what Italia just said.

245
00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:34.220
Danny Park: Right? The people that many people out there who enjoy interaction

246
00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:40.800
Danny Park: right? So that's where they're building humanoid robots to give you that interaction.

247
00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:49.960
Danny Park: Right? So it's so interesting. It's it's like, sorry I'm not gonna go through it here, but just the evolution of how technology mimics human evolution

248
00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:52.350
Danny Park: is very, very interesting.

249
00:27:52.810 --> 00:28:03.039
Danny Park: But to Natalia's point there is several entries industries right now who are ma? Who are making those androids to to bridge the gap. But Natalia said about the human experience. So there.

250
00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:07.989
Danny Park: when we talk about when we talk about digital literacy, right?

251
00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:23.509
Danny Park: We, it's important for us to all understand what that is, to build a digital mindset and then be able to apply our business understanding of the industry to make sure what the right balances. But going back to digital literacy right? And I just want everyone just to think about yourselves.

252
00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:31.799
Danny Park: just your own, just your own understanding where you are in this, in this spectrum. right? And it's not a knock, a criticism of anyone.

253
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:47.019
Danny Park: But we need to be very understanding of where we are where we sit here, because if we don't know where we are right, just like, just like as all business analyst, all business leaders, we need to know where what's happening right now, and we need to. You know we can't be lied to.

254
00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:50.029
Danny Park: so we can't lie to ourselves, either. Right?

255
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:52.580
Danny Park: You have to know where you are

256
00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.399
Danny Park: right. And for many.

257
00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:00.609
Danny Park: right? How is it that it's barely here.

258
00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:12.730
Danny Park: right? People. I see people, you know. I'm not gonna go anyone in this room. I'm just about in general, right? I see people with excel word. You know, you could write scripts in Google suite.

259
00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:20.969
Danny Park: We could automate Google, by yourself, Google suite, Google, Google slides and and and Google drive

260
00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:24.309
Danny Park: like, it's Google. The reason why it made it so.

261
00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:27.979
Danny Park: So novice looking is because they let you script a lot

262
00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:37.510
Danny Park: right? Same thing with Microsoft. Microsoft probably has the most api integrations against not only their internal suite, but external suite.

263
00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.750
Danny Park: Right? That's what power automate is.

264
00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:46.430
Danny Park: So as business analysts.

265
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:51.170
Danny Park: we have to solely climb this ladder of digital literacy.

266
00:29:52.310 --> 00:30:04.689
Danny Park: Right? So once we understand the business purpose for why this tool existed industry, then we could understand what we need to do with it to create the right type of content.

267
00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:14.030
Danny Park: So I'll use an easy example. There's a you know, clients right now. They want to create automation using Rpa

268
00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:15.590
Danny Park: right?

269
00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:27.739
Danny Park: And I teach Rpa class, by the way, and the whole Rpa class is basically like 20% of it is me saying that they're doing it all wrong. because what they're doing is they're ha. They're giving people access.

270
00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:29.520
Danny Park: And they're saying, Go create a bot.

271
00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:37.480
Danny Park: So what naturally happens? Right? I see them create bots

272
00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:41.849
Danny Park: that actually do ultra excel some functions.

273
00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:45.410
Danny Park: And they say, Oh, look at this bot I created, I automated math.

274
00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:51.719
Danny Park: So your company has excel. But you created a bot

275
00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:55.880
Danny Park: to do math to some functions. So you just wasted money

276
00:30:57.190 --> 00:31:00.319
Danny Park: right? Another example is that we had. We had one where

277
00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:05.360
Danny Park: they create, they created, they they created a bot where

278
00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:07.609
Danny Park: it was. What was it doing?

279
00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:13.740
Danny Park: It was going in, copying, pasting things from the web

280
00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.980
Danny Park: and then copying that back

281
00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:18.929
Danny Park: into their slides.

282
00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:32.059
Danny Park: But the reason, oh, yeah, good good use case. But since then it understands in the world of digital that many companies don't let you scrape

283
00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:37.670
Danny Park: their ui meaning. You can't go to Linkedin, and you can't scrape the information on Linkedin.

284
00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:48.580
Danny Park: It violates the user policy because they're trying to. They don't want. They want to protect people's privacy. So they're like you could look and copy could manually do it. But they don't want you, do. They don't want a crawler

285
00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:53.459
Danny Park: going around going to like 10,000 Linkedin pages

286
00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:55.120
Danny Park: to scrape data

287
00:31:55.390 --> 00:32:01.889
Danny Park: and and analyze PPI, that some people might have actually put on it by accident, like the phone numbers or emails and things like that.

288
00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:06.900
Danny Park: By the way, if you're on Linkedin, do not put your email and phone number on, please.

289
00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:17.479
Danny Park: Right, that stuff will be on your resume and you share it with the right. People. Don't leave it open on there on your social media. Just Fyi, that's like that's not good, anyway.

290
00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:19.380
Danny Park: So

291
00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:32.999
Danny Park: because they didn't understand right? Because digital is includes all that right understanding the purpose of the tool and why it's used for right. And you have to understand purpose of technologies to understand how to actually use it. So they're creating a bunch of bots that had made no sense.

292
00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:39.519
Danny Park: So this particular client built up to 400 bots, and only 2 actually serve the business purpose.

293
00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:46.429
Danny Park: So the loss on the Rpa project was 3 point something 1 million dollars, if I remember correctly.

294
00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:55.890
Danny Park: because no one in their organization was digitally literate because they assume that giving access to tools means they know what they're doing.

295
00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:59.579
Danny Park: It's like me giving

296
00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:00.710
Danny Park: a

297
00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:03.640
Danny Park: Shakespeare book to my 8 year old.

298
00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:06.200
Danny Park: She could read.

299
00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:09.859
Danny Park: but not at that level. So what you can do with the sheep, Shakespeare.

300
00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:17.770
Danny Park: right now I understand it. Take the wrong message. Not even read it. Probably used to squash a bug.

301
00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:25.430
Danny Park: So as business analysts, we have to understand

302
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:29.300
Danny Park: right. And it's completely okay, if you're only at the use phase

303
00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:37.569
Danny Park: and then kind of segue back to your curriculum. Your Mba curriculums are meant to get you Literate.

304
00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:41.730
Danny Park: We have to pick the right courses and not just look for the 4 point

305
00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.160
Danny Park: because no one cares.

306
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:47.790
Danny Park: Well, they only care about. Are you digital literate or not, and we'll find out they're gonna interview.

307
00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:56.580
Danny Park: I've actually asked that, like I had someone who come into, he had his he had a Uipath certificate, which he did.

308
00:33:56.630 --> 00:34:04.390
Danny Park: and my first question was like, What's the purpose of your path in the market? He had no idea. So he, that that interview didn't go so well with him

309
00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:06.199
Danny Park: for him. Right?

310
00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:07.240
So.

311
00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:10.889
Danny Park: So wait. Let me stop here. Any questions so far.

312
00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:14.030
Danny Park: Anything you covered any comments, anything.

313
00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:17.080
Danny Park: any thoughts.

314
00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:30.759
Esaline Jarvis: Professor. Quick question. Yes. You mentioned in rpa, but I really don't know what. Rp, oh, sorry automation.

315
00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:34.729
Esaline Jarvis: Okay, you're welcome. You're welcome.

316
00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:36.389
Esaline Jarvis: thank you.

317
00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:40.209
Paola Vargas: Hey, Professor? Yes, hey, Pauline! Hi!

318
00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:45.800
Paola Vargas: I had an example of something very similar at my organization.

319
00:34:45.909 --> 00:35:04.019
Paola Vargas: So we have a bunch of Project managers in our company, and one of the constant struggle is, you know, nobody's using really good effective tools to manage their projects. So the information systems, the Mis System Department launched Reich.

320
00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:10.280
Paola Vargas: and they said, Here you go. We've got this tool for you guys to help me manage your projects, but they never

321
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:19.539
Paola Vargas: ask folks is that if that's the tool that they want it, how to use it. It was like, maybe, like 10% usage at the end of the day. And

322
00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:27.789
Paola Vargas: oh, my God! Awesome example, and thank you for sharing, because I'm sure that is a pervasive example.

323
00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:35.030
Danny Park: I I'm sure everyone in this room went through it, and that's another example of not having a digital mindset.

324
00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:43.050
Danny Park: Right? Remember. So everyone I just want, I just wanna just make it clear because I'm gonna not be clear just because we have the word digital.

325
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:48.669
Danny Park: We're not only talk about data, right? Digital minded is a personal capability

326
00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:51.480
Danny Park: or way of thinking that enables

327
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.600
an individual us

328
00:35:53.750 --> 00:36:00.580
Danny Park: to imagine better technology enabled ways of getting things done. So in Paulo's example.

329
00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:03.660
Danny Park: right? And also in Italians, like everyone's example, right?

330
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:10.640
Danny Park: So. But but Powell's, you know Lee's example is they layered on a tool and said, Here you go.

331
00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:14.400
Danny Park: meaning they just give you access. They may be trained.

332
00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:25.560
Danny Park: Maybe something user, guide and train like a day or 2 some webcast training. No one's paying attention to right and say, Go ahead. But then, what do you? What do you? What do you expect them to do?

333
00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:33.290
Danny Park: Right? Because you have to start with, hey? What is it? Why is it beneficial to you? How can it help you. How can you better imagine

334
00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:34.630
Danny Park: the way of working

335
00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:46.840
Danny Park: right? So digital mindset was missing. Digital mindset wasn't missing because digital literacy was missing because there's no path to digital literacy for that particular project management group which happens all the time.

336
00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:49.399
Danny Park: Right, Eugenia, go ahead. Yeah.

337
00:36:50.400 --> 00:37:01.339
Eugenia Salgado: Yes. I wanted to ask you renewal, saying a little bit about the digital mindset is that like a new concept like, I'm asking you like, I'm trying to understand.

338
00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:12.180
Eugenia Salgado: we need to have that right like we we we that it's something like we will need to have. But I'm thinking about it at my job right now.

339
00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:34.079
Eugenia Salgado: it's like we use it. Basic stuff like excel access. And we need to pull that data and all that. But even with those little things that when you are trying to give ideas or try to do something to make some things more how you call it. Add to make it a little quickly.

340
00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:35.750
Eugenia Salgado: is like, people

341
00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:37.820
Eugenia Salgado: is like, I don't know

342
00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:42.889
Eugenia Salgado: what is the problem like if they are scared to make any changes or do something different.

343
00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:48.749
Danny Park: Yeah, yeah, no, great, no. Right? Right? And the resistance change is

344
00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:56.680
Danny Park: is a problem. But that resistant. The resistance to change is really led into

345
00:37:56.710 --> 00:38:09.259
Danny Park: broken digital literacy policies and programs. a reason why someone doesn't want to change the way they do it, because they're afraid, because they don't know what they're doing right. And most people don't want to be challenged upon the fact that they don't know what they're doing.

346
00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:16.179
Danny Park: But they don't know but it's not their fault right, for example, like, if those who work right, you've seen it before, like.

347
00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:22.660
Danny Park: if you just have access to a tool and you're told, users will make you better

348
00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:33.049
Danny Park: if the company doesn't tell you what digital literacy actually means, but how to get there? You're gonna assume that. Oh, I have this tool. Why am I not doing great stuff with it?

349
00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:42.790
Danny Park: Then when someone asks you why you're not doing great self with it, you're gonna feel like you're doing something wrong. So that's why I'm trying to get at is that. And that's why you see the line here.

350
00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.340
Danny Park: most of us right?

351
00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:54.130
Danny Park:  who don't get to work for really global leaders in technology.

352
00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:59.869
Danny Park: we're, we're told, you have the tool. So you're already good to go

353
00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:05.539
Danny Park: right? And because of that

354
00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:10.109
Danny Park: assumption that just cause you have the tool. It means you're a peer.

355
00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:13.660
Danny Park: You get groups

356
00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:19.650
Danny Park: just using technologies in a very incorrect way or in a complete way.

357
00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:34.090
Danny Park: and they've been doing it so long is that when you try to introduce, introduce a new tool they're like, well, why, you gave me access to the tool before it didn't help me. I still, I am still not good at it, because they assume they're right. They assume it's them, not the actual

358
00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:46.059
Danny Park: process of getting illiterate. Right. They don't want to adopt a new tool because they don't see the value in it, because they're like, well, cause that all that's all they know they think access is literacy.

359
00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:53.860
Danny Park: So as business analysts as future Mbas, when you get in your organization, your goal is to build a path to digital literacy.

360
00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:05.649
Danny Park: Right. Oh, and again, I'm not. I'm not. I'm not being biased towards Pw. I'm not loosing. I'm not saying that Peter is the best organization in the world. But here at Peterbc we have

361
00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:08.419
Danny Park: distinct digital literacy roadmaps.

362
00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:13.860
Danny Park: we have digital mindset badges like we are all expected to take like

363
00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:23.859
Danny Park: a series of courses to where at the end, you get a badge, saying you are. You have past digital man, either digital minds the curriculum and then build upon that.

364
00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:37.990
Danny Park: because here at, you know, here at Pwc. And most of other global firms, we understand that we have to get people digitally literate, or as not, everyone's gonna adopt, of course. But we're gonna get. We have to get as many people in our organization

365
00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:40.629
Danny Park: going higher in this

366
00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:47.999
Danny Park: hierarchy to get them as close to Literate as possible, because that's the only way for them to adopt the digital mindset.

367
00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:53.380
Danny Park: So to some.

368
00:40:55.230 --> 00:41:02.659
Danny Park: do not expect your team members to have a digital mindset. If you did not have a path for them to be digitally literate

369
00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:10.139
Danny Park: and to be digitally literate, it's beyond just more than access. It's beyond more than use.

370
00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:20.610
Danny Park: Right? Remember, use. It's like, you know, like navigation at. And I'll just using it. Normally. you have to help them understand why that tool exists, and the ecosystem of tools they have.

371
00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:34.049
Danny Park: Why that? Why, why, that tool not only exists in their company, why exist in market, how it ties to other technology and other processes or other information systems. Remember, now, think information system now

372
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:53.739
Danny Park: and then, once they understand the purpose behind it in market and in their own organization, how it touches other systems, then they could create. So let me use Rpa robotic process automation as the example the good one. I think I seen a client create one automation that literally saved 1.3 million dollars

373
00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:58.419
Danny Park: right? Because they understood

374
00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:00.569
Danny Park: what Rp is meant to do.

375
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:08.480
Danny Park: They were very. They were very meticulous around training their team members. When Rpa is how it affects the information system

376
00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:17.009
Danny Park: in the organization which technologies that it needs to bridge to why they need to do it in the organization and why Rpa exists in the market.

377
00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:19.160
Danny Park: Then they let them create the box.

378
00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.869
Danny Park: So that's the difference you get

379
00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:32.660
Danny Park: between just giving people assuming access means literacy versus actually building a pipeline to be literate

380
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:37.480
Danny Park: and

381
00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:43.480
Danny Park: to really tie all together. The best analogy is, it's like you're reading up like when you, when you learn how to read.

382
00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:57.620
Danny Park: you don't start reading right at the Shakespeare level, you start with the Abcs first, and you understand how each word sounds. Letter sounds, and you have to understand how each letter sounds against the actual when it's combined with other letters.

383
00:42:58.620 --> 00:42:59.440
Danny Park: Right?

384
00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:06.629
Danny Park: Some letters sound different if they're

385
00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.310
Danny Park: next to other letters.

386
00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:20.829
Danny Park: So now you understand, like you, now you're using the language, then then you become understanding right context. When I speak I use like slang and things like that, or you understand the variations of the language.

387
00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:25.149
Danny Park: So you know all the different, you know.

388
00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:33.819
Danny Park: phrases, sayings, things like that. So now you're really communicating. Then, when you are really strong, communicated understanding language, then you can actually write a book

389
00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:39.130
Danny Park: that are the people gonna read and go. Oh, this is such a good book, and you make your 1 million dollars

390
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:50.680
Danny Park: right? You should not assume technology. Is that straightforward and that easy where you could just give them access to it. And they could be Literate in a day or 2.

391
00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:55.550
So now that comes down to after we. We're literate

392
00:43:55.860 --> 00:44:01.739
Danny Park: right? Any any questions so far, any comments? Sorry. Just before I move on, Lennon, go ahead.

393
00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:06.540
Leonard (Wess): I just have a quick

394
00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:29.560
Leonard (Wess): example of of what? What were you just talking about? So at the school work? I work at this school in the Bronx, and they we built the studio production studio, where I teach, and they had other professors come in, and they showed them the equipment and told me had access to all this equipment. You know the cameras and different components and editing equipment and you know, screen boards and

395
00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:50.270
Leonard (Wess): confidence monitors and things like that. But they never really taught anyone how to utilize the equipment. And since I already, you know, I already have a digital you know, knowledge of. I have knowledge about how to ha! I'm digitally savvy, and I saw know how to use this equipment already, like I didn't really need to go full. Go through like all the training.

396
00:44:50.270 --> 00:45:18.050
Leonard (Wess): But, you know, like 6 months later, they were wondering like, Why isn't anyone using the equipment other than me? So I like started teaching this class, and then everyone else is looking at me like, well, how come you know how to do that? Cause you naturally have the digital mindset. You wanna imagine better ways and take better technology enabled ways of getting things done. No, that's awesome, Leonard, that really shows you leadership, the technology leadership. Yeah.

397
00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:21.740
Danny Park: But I. But I like I I'm hoping

398
00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:23.190
Danny Park: that

399
00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:27.730
Danny Park: you know, as a group, we're understanding why this is so important.

400
00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:37.050
Danny Park: like the digital literacy part. And you and and we have to build, we have to build toward the digital mindset. So once we have digital mindset.

401
00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:42.409
Danny Park: then we're gonna start understanding the difference between digitization and digitalization.

402
00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:48.760
Danny Park: Right? These 2, these 2, these 2 concepts are very important for us

403
00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:52.910
Danny Park: to take away as business analysts on the data side.

404
00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:55.969
Danny Park: Right? So what is digitization.

405
00:45:56.440 --> 00:46:04.619
Danny Park: Digitization is a process of converting analog, right? Meaning things are not data or digital into a digital format.

406
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:08.449
Danny Park: Right? And this kind of goes back to my earlier comment of.

407
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:19.679
Danny Park: there's a lot of knowledge and information that's shared. That's not in digital form. As analog, right? It's people talking. It's like me speaking now, I'm sharing all I know in knowledge.

408
00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:26.360
Danny Park: and is being captured luckily in digital format by zoom, and also zoom script

409
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:34.570
Danny Park: right? But how many other times do we have conversations in our lives where we're sharing knowledge with one another

410
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:40.770
Danny Park: that sometimes it's only knowledge experiences that one person knows but is never captured anywhere.

411
00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:43.560
Danny Park: So

412
00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:53.170
Danny Park: as future looking business analysts, we have to figure out, okay, what's the right balance? What do we need to actually get in digital format which things

413
00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:54.440
Danny Park: we don't have to.

414
00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:57.799
Danny Park: To Natalia's earlier point, there's a cost element to it.

415
00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:09.959
Danny Park: But to know the balance of what to digit, digitize. That's a business analyst function, because you need to understand the business and the data.

416
00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:22.020
Danny Park: remember, and the business and data, they have more. Right? I I'm always gonna go back to I wanna I wanna remind ourselves, remember, the data side has did a life cycle data infrastructure and all those things that we covered. So far.

417
00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.080
Danny Park: So we have to balance those things out.

418
00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:26.980
Danny Park: Okay?

419
00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:32.610
Danny Park: And then after you digitize. So you have the data that you need

420
00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:34.130
Danny Park: to be able to

421
00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:37.140
Danny Park: create or do analytics on.

422
00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:40.629
Danny Park: Then we could start talking about digitalization.

423
00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:48.049
Danny Park: right? Which is bringing or using digital technologies to transform enhanced business processes.

424
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:50.200
Danny Park: Right?

425
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:56.390
Danny Park: And I'll use Jen and I as an example, kind of bringing that up right tying back that example is

426
00:47:57.250 --> 00:48:08.179
Danny Park: we want, we want to create this digital digital technology called generative AI. The value of denariative a. I is driven by the value of what we teach it.

427
00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:11.739
Danny Park: So if we didn't digitize knowledge

428
00:48:13.070 --> 00:48:16.529
Danny Park: and information very key things.

429
00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:21.589
Danny Park: then, how are we? How are we going to digitalize it?

430
00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:28.780
Danny Park: Right? Meaning how we gonna create the digital technology, it's gonna help us the way we transform the way we work.

431
00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:38.090
Danny Park: So these 2 are always interchanging back and forth.

432
00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:41.090
Danny Park: These 2 are the culmination

433
00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:47.200
Danny Park: of the digital mindset, which is the result of digital literacy.

434
00:48:48.830 --> 00:48:51.369
Danny Park: We cannot be business analysts

435
00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:56.150
Danny Park: if we are not doing these 2 things.

436
00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:06.310
Danny Park: because how can we ever assess data quality if we don't have a mind to, hey? Did you actually capture knowledge and digital format?

437
00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:13.810
Danny Park: Very important.

438
00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:20.350
Danny Park: especially those with an Mba degree? Donald. Donald, go ahead.

439
00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:34.120
Donald Rada: Yeah, Professor. Have you heard about the Sats being Computer version. Now. they're transitioning to it. Would you consider that being digitization or digitalization? Or is it a combination of both.

440
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:45.480
Danny Park: No, it's a combination of both. I mean, it's a system that's gonna it's gonna capture responses to digitize responses. And it's gonna great. It's like the Cp exams. But

441
00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:52.010
Danny Park: to get to get that platform the Sats right like the the back engine of it.

442
00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:56.829
Danny Park: It was just a it was a complete interaction between digitization, digitalization.

443
00:49:57.210 --> 00:50:05.740
Danny Park: Great question. By the way, Don. So every every technology that we have that's AI and fuse has been this partnership between digitization digitalization.

444
00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:17.050
Danny Park: And how do we know that those companies aware of these 2 interactions is when you look at? I think we, I, we mentioned this about Chat Gbt, when you go chat, Gbt has a giant disclaimer on there.

445
00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:30.210
Danny Park: right? It's basically telling you we're as good as the data that we captured. But when we actually think about is like, Okay, you're as good as the data you capture. The data you capture depends on what you actually digitize.

446
00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:42.989
Danny Park: Right? So it's it's very again like. And this reason why this is important, because everyone in this room, if you so choose

447
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:46.780
Danny Park: right to to go as far as you want, you will be executives one day.

448
00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:55.629
Danny Park: All executives today, in my opinion, are all tech executives. If you don't have these 2 things in mind, you don't know how to run a business

449
00:50:57.020 --> 00:51:11.539
Danny Park: right cause. Everything right now is so data infused that if you have a process and you know that process and manual, but that manual process is so important that capturing the key data points that come out of that process being executed, can feed

450
00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:17.860
Danny Park: or inform other technologies to make those technologies better, you should be digitizing it.

451
00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:24.820
Danny Park: But if these 2 concepts are the furthest from your mind, what are you actually leading? Where are you leading your company into.

452
00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:27.619
Danny Park: Besides the Stone Age

453
00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:32.940
Danny Park: compared to the other companies whose executives have these 2 things in mind

454
00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:35.240
Danny Park: continuously every day.

455
00:51:37.570 --> 00:51:44.919
Danny Park: and they're bringing their individual employees up the path visual literacy so they can digitize things

456
00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:48.179
Danny Park: for the company. So the company can't digital lies.

457
00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:51.980
Danny Park: I remember digital literacy

458
00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:55.760
Danny Park: create. You're digitizing

459
00:52:00.830 --> 00:52:09.819
Danny Park: right. So then, to cap off the last like 1015 min, let's talk about which industries haven't really caught up

460
00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:21.960
Danny Park: right with digitization, meaning which industries are really have transformed the manual way of working into a digital format

461
00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:23.790
Danny Park: whose member

462
00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:39.439
Danny Park: everyone started in the Stone Age right? And then we had an industrial revolution. We. Everyone was writing things on paper. Then the computer was invented. The computer was invented. So people can digitize to communicate better and to build better technologies.

463
00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:48.470
Danny Park: But and just I actually, wanna bring wanna bring it into really focus. The purpose of the it. Age was to basically do these 2 things.

464
00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:54.660
Danny Park: So there are some companies that have been better at digitization than others

465
00:52:55.170 --> 00:52:59.680
Danny Park: to Natalia's point. Right? You have to have a

466
00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:04.949
Danny Park: cost benefit. So when we look at this, when we look at this chart.

467
00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:09.000
Danny Park: it's not like, Oh, boo-hoo! You're so bad at digitization.

468
00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:14.680
Danny Park: We have to apply our digital analysis skills and go. Oh, why why are they not digitizing

469
00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:17.449
Danny Park: like what's really holding them back?

470
00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:25.559
Danny Park: Right? Is it a people gap? Is it a technology gap? Is it a cultural gap like you have to talk about these things

471
00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:31.019
Danny Park: right? Cause one. Everyone in this room will be in one of these industries.

472
00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:41.450
Danny Park: So if we're in one of these industries. As a business leader with a foundation of business analytics, we have to at least know where where we are

473
00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:44.369
Danny Park: right, what industry are in and where are we in digitization

474
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:47.890
Danny Park: right on Natalia? Go ahead. And then, Eugenia, go ahead after.

475
00:53:48.560 --> 00:54:04.779
Natallia’s iPhone: Yeah, you were asking. I don't know if it's the time to give examples like which companies or industries they're good at. Okay? So I think II can think of 3 that are clearly sending out so like accounting. Right used to be all on the paper.

476
00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:31.419
Natallia’s iPhone: Now it's all in in the systems. And similarly with the finance like Stock Exchange, right? It used to be papers. You know, the brokers filling out orders and the papers. Now it's all electronic. And then another thing I can think of completely different is the medical billing is all digitized used to be also, you know, manually submitted.

477
00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:34.620
Danny Park: and health care side on the private hospitals.

478
00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:48.239
Danny Park: The government side, anyone on the Government side of healthcare. You know all the paperwork there. But but absolutely, I agree, like great examples, and you'll see on this chart how professional services

479
00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:50.920
Danny Park: right? Which is the accounting

480
00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:55.620
Danny Park: right counting. And you know the Big 4 and things like that, you see, like almost everything's green

481
00:54:57.010 --> 00:55:09.109
Danny Park: right? And then finance right? Natalia also mentioned almost everything's green to like green. So they're they're they're getting up there. And you see all the red ones here, right? Like agricultural hunting like, okay, when you shoot a dock, you know, do you have to like register that

482
00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:20.430
Danny Park: on a tablet? Right? But but when we look at this from a business, analytical perspective, right? Business analytics, meaning business and data. Right? We go. Wait a minute.

483
00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:27.450
Danny Park: And and agricultural hunting. Right? Is there some business problem in agricultural hunting

484
00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:29.589
Danny Park: that, let's say a drone

485
00:55:30.570 --> 00:55:33.699
Danny Park: right can help digitize and map

486
00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:34.930
Danny Park: area

487
00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:40.280
Danny Park: and then capture or be able to identify. Let's say, the movement of locusts.

488
00:55:41.050 --> 00:55:49.079
Danny Park: those data points and then provide you a predictive analytics and also prescriptive on where they're going to go and how to hit them.

489
00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:52.110
Danny Park: Meaning, what should you do to to kill the locusts?

490
00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:57.280
Danny Park: Right? Maybe that's a really great future looking technology

491
00:55:57.420 --> 00:56:07.880
Danny Park: solution. Right? So like, this is what this map is for. Again. It's not about Boo! Hoo! It's like we have to think through and go. Oh, wait a minute. All the red are the opportunity areas

492
00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:20.740
Danny Park: where, if I'm a consultant, or if I'm a business analyst and want to go work for that industry, I know III want to go figure out how to make a name for myself right Eugenia. Go ahead.

493
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.340
Harini: Oh, hello, yes.

494
00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:45.660
Eugenia Salgado: Oh, oh, this is Virginia. Okay? So I was. I was about to add you to this like an example with the between the different digitalization and digitization. But I was thinking, on this, and do tell me if I'm correct or not. This is like on a specific example. So at Baruch, you.

495
00:56:45.660 --> 00:57:09.969
Eugenia Salgado: Joni, when George as a student, if you're trying to pay in state tuition. You need to fill out a residency form. So digitization is like the process. They have right now that they give you the paper, the physically, the paper. You need to fill it out, even though the documents to submit to process that application and that form and the supporting documents. Everything is like hard copies.

496
00:57:10.310 --> 00:57:12.620
Eugenia Salgado: and they process that that way.

497
00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:23.069
Eugenia Salgado: That would be digitization. But if I wanna do the digitalization on this residency, one process is that I create that

498
00:57:23.090 --> 00:57:24.190
Eugenia Salgado: form

499
00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:27.660
Eugenia Salgado: so they can fill it out electronically.

500
00:57:27.810 --> 00:57:36.939
Danny Park: It would. Yeah, correct. It would be like, instead of you filling it out manually on paper. They will probably pull from from other system that already has your data.

501
00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:42.099
Danny Park: that. So that's digital like great example. That's digitalization.

502
00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:44.249
Eugenia Salgado: Alright, absolutely. Yeah. You're welcome.

503
00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:54.580
Harini: This is Harini Harini. Yeah. Yeah. So the the graph that you showed of the industries that have still not digitized

504
00:57:54.610 --> 00:58:00.049
Harini:  after Covid. Don't you think this would have changed a bit.

505
00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:02.510
Danny Park: Yeah, I know

506
00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:10.689
Danny Park: me, too, but but obviously not right. But it's it's not

507
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:21.150
Danny Park: again. But it's not to say shame on you. Kind of thing, right? There's sometimes there are to contagious earlier point. There are some business pressures that would might prevent digitization.

508
00:58:21.450 --> 00:58:27.240
Danny Park: But it's the business analyst role within that given industry to go wait a minute like, why, like.

509
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:35.470
Danny Park: let's get better and digitizing because we have to catch up with all this right? So I get, I think, the latest one. I think

510
00:58:35.730 --> 00:58:42.469
Danny Park: it's not really to Covid. That's really good example, like you, you know. Really good question you you brought up. But it's retail.

511
00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:45.640
Danny Park: So what's happening retail lately?

512
00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:49.200
Danny Park: Anyone, it's like

513
00:58:50.460 --> 00:59:07.300
Danny Park: lot of lot of digitization and retail. Right? Yeah, because, like, but they know they are. They're figuring out they have to get there. But what what is this? What is a business pressure happening that no one really expected for them to figure out, oh, my God! We gotta start digitizing.

514
00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:12.610
Danny Park: you know. It's all yes, online shopping's one. But but there, there were some retail

515
00:59:12.670 --> 00:59:20.799
Danny Park: that we're sort of resistant to online shopping, believe it or not. But what what have it been? Have? What have we been seeing in the news

516
00:59:21.130 --> 00:59:24.119
Danny Park: that's making people talk about it.

517
00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:34.009
Eugenia Salgado: That Joe, they are using how you call it that you paid yourself. There's no more people needed like as a cashier.

518
00:59:34.050 --> 00:59:38.889
Danny Park: No, yeah, yeah, that, too. But but why like? But but there's a business issue

519
00:59:38.910 --> 00:59:47.100
Danny Park: that's happy. Yeah. So the prices are going up. People cannot afford buying. So they have to cut somewhere.

520
00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:48.940
Danny Park: Prices are going up.

521
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:52.010
Danny Park: And because prices are going up, theft is increasing.

522
00:59:52.330 --> 00:59:58.209
Danny Park: Yeah, Yup, theft is increasing. They're like, Oh, my God.

523
00:59:59.110 --> 01:00:02.920
Danny Park: we have to close doors. cause we're taking massive hits.

524
01:00:02.970 --> 01:00:13.530
Danny Park: and when you hear theft it's not, it's not the theft that's driving revenue down is that when you hear people when you hear. When you see someone stealing from a store, you don't want to go back to the store

525
01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:15.589
Danny Park: because things can get violent.

526
01:00:16.850 --> 01:00:18.640
Danny Park: So theft.

527
01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:24.049
Danny Park: High prices is increasing the the volume of theft

528
01:00:24.550 --> 01:00:25.450
Danny Park: which is

529
01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:30.709
Danny Park: creating behaviors with people going toward online shopping.

530
01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:35.020
Danny Park: So Cbs and target are closing store at a rapid pace.

531
01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:41.619
Danny Park: So they're like, Oh, oops. we need a digitization strategy.

532
01:00:42.090 --> 01:00:46.229
Danny Park: So we could digitalize and get on the online market

533
01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:53.920
Danny Park: right? So it's that type of business analysis, awareness

534
01:00:54.590 --> 01:00:59.239
Danny Park: to understand how it's going to impact the data, analytics, strategy

535
01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:02.169
Danny Park: and the eventual solution.

536
01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:15.069
Danny Park: But all those things relate right to tell you hit the nail on the head price. Okay, price happened. And what happened after from business analysis, perspective, theft, what happens after theft, behavior change? What happened? Behavior change lowest revenue.

537
01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:18.950
Danny Park: So those 4 things was that business analysis layer.

538
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:24.849
Danny Park: Then we go, wait a minute. How does it gonna impact the data? Now, we're putting our digital mindset hat on.

539
01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:31.120
Danny Park: And we're like, Oh, we're gonna start. Got to start start thinking about this stuff

540
01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:41.579
Danny Park: which analytics do we do to really prove out. We need to close those stores, which they did. By the way, they didn't just go close the stores. They applied some data analytics. They did descriptive analytics.

541
01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:52.919
Danny Park: Then they did. Then it did predictive analytics, meaning what would happen if this level of theft keeps going up. And they said, What should we do next close the stores.

542
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:59.389
Danny Park: Folks that's Mba level thinking.

543
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.569
Danny Park: not multiple choice. Right?

544
01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:08.279
Danny Park: Alright. So

545
01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:27.230
Danny Park: this is pretty much the path that ends up happening. You digitize. Then you digitalize, then you digitally transform. So here's here. I'll I'll cover. Let's cover. I'll cover slide 9. I think we might continue on with this in our next session.

546
01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.040
Danny Park: This is very important.

547
01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:32.739
Danny Park: but I'll end the last 4 min with this is.

548
01:02:33.310 --> 01:02:36.840
Danny Park: you see, a lot of the who here has a term digital transformation.

549
01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:54.259
Danny Park: Yeah, I have heard this. Yeah, yeah, it's I'm sure many other people have. Right? Yeah, like, Avery, like, I'm I'm sure you guys see rules out there for digital transformation manager or some some something like that. Right? Okay? So here's where a lot of firms go wrong.

550
01:02:54.450 --> 01:02:56.710
Danny Park: Just like how we talk about digital literacy.

551
01:02:57.710 --> 01:03:02.559
Danny Park: Right? We go to digital literacy slide. We see people thinking that you just give them access.

552
01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:07.389
Danny Park: Then all of a sudden, they're literate. right? This. So this is a tactical level.

553
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:13.369
Danny Park: right? Tactical meaning. You're getting people to do something so tactically, they're making a mistake.

554
01:03:13.570 --> 01:03:16.039
They thinking you give access. Then they get Literate

555
01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:20.960
Danny Park: strategically. Unfortunately, some companies make the same mistake.

556
01:03:22.410 --> 01:03:24.340
Danny Park: They go from

557
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:37.309
Danny Park: almost nothing to digital transformation. So let me. So digital transformation is is a series of deep and coordinated culture

558
01:03:37.590 --> 01:03:50.159
Danny Park: workforce and technology shifts that enable a new educational operating model and transforming in institutions. Basically, you're transforming the entire way of doing business.

559
01:03:50.890 --> 01:03:52.840
Danny Park: That's digital transformation.

560
01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:59.270
Danny Park: What many people confuse digital transformation with. They confuse it with digitization.

561
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:03.800
Danny Park: So when I'm working.

562
01:04:03.850 --> 01:04:11.689
Danny Park: and I'm hearing, you know, friends and colleagues and and clients say, Oh, we're in a digital transformation program.

563
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:15.390
Danny Park: We're digitally transforming. And I go. Oh, what are you doing?

564
01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:20.470
Danny Park: They go. Oh, we're we. We started to put things into digital format.

565
01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:24.329
Danny Park: So I'm like, you're how you digital transforming?

566
01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:29.159
Danny Park: Right? You are literally in digitization mode.

567
01:04:30.690 --> 01:04:36.929
Danny Park: So why is that important? Why is that important right? Why? Why is that important to know that that they're wrong?

568
01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:41.260
Danny Park: Why confusing digital transformation with digitization is completely wrong.

569
01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:45.100
Danny Park: Digital transformation means

570
01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:54.099
Danny Park: that you're trying to compete in a different way. If, strategically, your milestones are based on how to do things different.

571
01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:59.550
Danny Park: Usually your human capital strategy is going to hire

572
01:04:59.930 --> 01:05:05.540
Danny Park: for individuals who want, who want to step in and do something very new.

573
01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:19.209
Danny Park: If someone comes in or hire to do something new that no one has done before. But the rest of the organization stuck on trying to get what they do today. Digital.

574
01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:23.130
Danny Park: How do you think that interaction is going to play out.

575
01:05:25.770 --> 01:05:27.399
Danny Park: It's gonna be, it's gonna go south.

576
01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:30.570
Danny Park: Right? So

577
01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:43.850
Danny Park: this slide, the important part is to digitally transform. You have to go through your stages of digitization and then digitalization, then digital transformation.

578
01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:46.560
But before these 3 things can happen.

579
01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:50.150
Danny Park: right? You need people to

580
01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:57.559
Danny Park: be digitally literate. then to adopt a digital mindset. So digital literacy starts first

581
01:05:57.950 --> 01:06:03.629
Danny Park: so they can adopt the digital mind set to understand how and what to digitize.

582
01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:12.199
Danny Park: Then, after you digitize and you start getting more information in a digital format. Then you start to create technologies.

583
01:06:12.610 --> 01:06:23.610
Danny Park: to make process or to automate processes. And once you have a good collection of manual processes that are now automated. Then you can start transforming

584
01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.040
Danny Park: how you want to do business.

585
01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:44.320
Danny Park: because now you're providing new value propositions to clients and other internal customers saying, Hey, we automated this stuff. It's more accurate. It's faster. What opportunities can we leverage in the market to take on? Maybe like for Amazon, for example, they were selling books. Now they're making movies.

586
01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:48.360
Danny Park: Think about Amazon.

587
01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:51.390
Danny Park: Amazon literally does this.

588
01:06:51.410 --> 01:06:52.910
Danny Park: Over and over again

589
01:06:53.110 --> 01:07:00.820
Danny Park: they went from selling physical books to then digitizing those books into digital format

590
01:07:01.310 --> 01:07:07.879
Danny Park: that as it became digital format, they were creating a gathering, a lot of content and licensing

591
01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:10.400
Danny Park: to start building products.

592
01:07:10.690 --> 01:07:25.530
Danny Park: digitalization to build products to deliver you that digitized content of that book. Then they're able to. Now, because all the experience they have in digitization digitalizes the

593
01:07:25.590 --> 01:07:29.279
Danny Park: lizing to build your movies and TV shows.

594
01:07:32.670 --> 01:07:38.970
Danny Park: That's digital transformation. Amazon. Google Meta.

595
01:07:41.070 --> 01:07:48.029
Danny Park: Only very few organizations in industry have actually achieved digital transformation. And they do it very well.

596
01:07:50.530 --> 01:07:57.689
Danny Park: Not many organizations have gone there. They say they have gone to their departments, and people who do it, but there have not been there.

597
01:07:58.930 --> 01:08:08.239
Danny Park: They're either in digitize, digitize, digitization or digitalization. They're either one of these 2 things, and sometimes they actually sit here and cycles.

598
01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:10.159
Danny Park: and they never get to hear

599
01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:14.840
Danny Park: to Leonard's point because they can't scale.

600
01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:19.459
Danny Park: So the example of Mckinsey.

601
01:08:20.939 --> 01:08:24.999
Danny Park: right? Mckenzie, the example of where they digitize their knowledge.

602
01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:32.050
Danny Park: then they digitalize it by building a technology that disseminates that digitized knowledge.

603
01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:39.089
Danny Park: Then they could. Then they, and arguably had digitally transformed because they transformed their whole entire business model.

604
01:08:44.979 --> 01:08:53.759
Danny Park: So we're we'll end here. But before we end, and we'll pick this back up next next our next session. Any questions, comments

605
01:08:55.609 --> 01:09:00.359
Danny Park: Hope. This was another like hopefully. There's another interesting session. Hope there's a lot of learnings from it.

606
01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:17.220
Danny Park: If there any questions again, feel free to email me, set up office hours with me as well. especially with career stuff. I love. Talk about career stuff as well. And then no other further questions or comments. Everyone have a great night and great weekend, and see you next week.

607
01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:21.890
Leonard (Wess): Thank you very much for you, too.

608
01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:24.970
Esaline Jarvis: Thank you, Professor. Thank you. Have a good night, Professor.
