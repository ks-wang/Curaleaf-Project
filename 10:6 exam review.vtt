00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.010
Recording.

2
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.280
Danny Park: I hope everyone had

3
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:11.470
Danny Park: a great week. Happy Friday apologies for last week crazy things just popped up so I couldn't

4
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.150
Danny Park: attend a live version that that the

5
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:31.659
Danny Park: I thought I was in Miami, the amount of rain that was coming down in the middle of a hurricane I've been. I've been through a couple of hurricanes, I was like, Oh, my God, it's pretty bad! So I was pretty much stuck in traffic subways being swamped. I don't know any reason why kind of cancel, because I felt like there might be other

6
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:41.459
Danny Park: team members here in class who, popping the same situation I was. So there's no way I was, gonna have, you know, put the extra anxiety to kind of log in, or or miss a

7
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:49.730
Danny Park: a a lecture. So luckily I had that that topic already pre recorded, so I was able to share it so hopefully. Everyone had time to consume it.

8
00:00:50.280 --> 00:01:00.180
Danny Park: When looking at our schedule. So you'll see this style schedule that's posted. I'll I will Update our schedule on blackboard to reflect. But you see here.

9
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:12.389
Danny Park: So what you see in green are the focus areas on Exam one, so meaning that a exam question will come from one of these topics you see in green. So it's going to be the information system

10
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.050
Danny Park: data quality data issues and impacts on decision making strategic business analytics.

11
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:34.559
Danny Park: introduction to machine learning and AI and deep dive on data strategy. The 2 that you see in like grayish or light blue. There'll be no questions taken directly from that content, however

12
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.229
Danny Park: understanding or being aware of what's

13
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:56.759
Danny Park: in those lectures, may help answer the essay questions on the exam a little bit more. Thoroughly. So. So what does that mean? That means that if you have a really good understanding of data models and big data and database manager systems right then you don't have to go back and review.

14
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:12.709
Danny Park: But if you don't, if this is the first time you actually come across these topics, and you need a basic refresher on what those are listening to lecturers and using them as study aids for the other. Content would be beneficial.

15
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.830
Danny Park: Alright? So any questions on that.

16
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.169
Danny Park: So far it's before I continue, I think, all good.

17
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:28.060
Danny Park: Alright, so let me let me keep going. So then, what is the the format of the exam? So my exams are

18
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.669
Danny Park: essay question based? There are 5 questions.

19
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:39.670
Danny Park: and each question is worth 20 points. and the quality of the answer. We'll determine

20
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.320
Danny Park: the grade for that particular question, and then at the end, I aggregate all the all the

21
00:02:47.310 --> 00:03:00.449
Danny Park: the the the scores for each question, and then you get your total, and we'll go over a sample essay. Question. What? It's for those, maybe, who join late. I posted a sample question with the answer on blackboard.

22
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:16.399
Danny Park: So a good in the past. What students used to do is they would actually answer that question before looking at the answer. and then they would then compare a the 20 point answer. And, by the way, that 20 point answer was an answer that was given by a previous student

23
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:26.780
Danny Park: who took the course. No background in the BA, no background data, analytics, all. All they did was just really take time to understand the content that's delivered in in our lectures.

24
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:38.570
Danny Park: So use that as a guide to to understand what the definition of comprehensive means for this for our

25
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:51.659
Danny Park: assessment. So the logistics it's take home. There's no need to be on zoom next week. October thirteenth. I make the exam available on blackboard for download

26
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.630
Danny Park: at 5 50, so that basically, you know the time that we start our usual class.

27
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:04.389
Danny Park: and the due date for that exam for our Exam. Is at 9 Pm. So 9 at 7 15 Pm. Is at 9 pm.

28
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.620
Danny Park: Right? Because I want to give the full 3Â h. Also. I wanna ensure that

29
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:34.670
Danny Park: I like to work around people's schedules. I know, during a lot of us work full time things pop up. We can't sometimes join class because we are in in meetings. Or is there some senior person who is who's knocking at your door. So I give that flexibility to let people operate on their own time. However, in exchange for that flexibility. My 9 Pm. Deadline is sharp.

30
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:56.960
Danny Park: If you hand that test in for me late into me late, you get paying it penalize, and it's covered on the syllabus. Okay, and all the all these exam logistics are also in the syllabus. So if you don't want to review the recording and figure out what the logistics are. You could either go back to this schedule where I'll post you'll see it to update it version, or you can just go to the syllabus. But I'm really serious about my due date

31
00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:03.289
Danny Park: because of that flexibility. There's really no reason, unless it's really mismanagement of time.

32
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:13.890
Danny Park: There's no reason to hand in it late. So a. A. An example, you know. Couple of semesters ago, a student handed in at 1115 pm. Around 1115. And this 20 point penalty.

33
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:24.949
Danny Park: Okay? And and he would have got 100. But you end up getting an 80. So I'm very serious out of fairness for everyone. The due date is is, that's the one thing I will not negotiate on. Hopefully. Everyone understands

34
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.979
Danny Park: and respects that submissions of the exam is through blackboard, using the link.

35
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:58.430
Danny Park: however, as backup, you can email me right, because I know blackboard is you know, I heard Burgers moving away from blackboard. I like had a Thank God moment. But anyway, I know how I know Brooke has a lot. I know blackboard has a lot of issues right sometimes there are things that I post up there, and I see I get it, I see, like a little hanging, and never posts. So I understand that. So if if you feel that blackboard is unreliable.

36
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:06.879
Danny Park: And you want to email me, you can for sure email me. But the email is still the same deadline. It's still 9 Pm. Deadline. So you can email me, you could use a link doesn't matter.

37
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:27.300
Danny Park: The link will. However, the link on blackboard. I have it to shut off at 9 0 one pm, so if you end up using blackboard and you're trying to go in at 9 pm. Let's say, just turns at 9 0 one. It might actually give you that error message if it doesn't, but it doesn't get submitted. So if you're like at 8 59 pm. About to hand it in. I will probably email it

38
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:34.890
Danny Park: instead of using blackboard just just because I know how and unreliable blackboard can be alright. So we covered the submission process.

39
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.949
Danny Park: So I will be on zoom

40
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.740
Danny Park: next week from 5 50 to 7, 15

41
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:57.149
Danny Park: for anyone who wants to hop on the same zoom, link, zoom, link, and ask me any questions. Right? You know. Sometimes you're going into an exam. You don't really understand what I'm trying to ask or what the question is asking, and you need clear clarification. I'll be around till 7 15 to provide the answers. However.

42
00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.650
Danny Park: I will not stay beyond 7 15.

43
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:11.469
Danny Park: Okay, so it's it's complete option to hop on or not. But that's part of like the time management that would ask everyone to consider is that if you know, I'm not going to be available at 7 15,

44
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.490
Danny Park: and

45
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.649
Danny Park: you might have a question.

46
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:28.400
Danny Park: you know, about one of the questions on the exam. It might not make sense to actually open the exam at 7 20 right? Maybe you don't want to take the exam at right at 5 50. Maybe you want some extra review time before you take the exam

47
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:38.580
Danny Park: right? Just open that 5 50. Read through the question. See if you understand. Don't understand. If you have some misunderstanding or or not clear about particular question. Hop onto zoom, I'll be here.

48
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:59.099
Danny Park: I do. I will monitor my email actively, but I can't promise you that I will able to answer your question. So what does that mean? It means that, let's say you're not the only one to email me a question after 9, after 7 15, right? So if you're not the first person in with the email, and I'm I'm in the middle of answering other emails.

49
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:08.359
Danny Park: And I don't get to your question by the time you have to hand it in. Then that's you know, we just had a luck at that point. So just be aware that you know.

50
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.580
Danny Park: the avenues of communication can be blocked based on the volume.

51
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:16.139
Danny Park: That's not a volume that's being used. Okay.

52
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:25.039
Danny Park: alright. And then and we covered the 5 essay question format. So I'll stop here any questions around the exam logistics and the format of the exam.

53
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:35.259
Danny Park: Alright, I think I think we're good. I hope? Any. Okay, Deanne, go ahead.

54
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:50.600
Dian Chen: Can we do? We have to answer each of the questions in essence format? Or would it be beneficial to kind of just pull it, pointing out. Sure. Great question, I bullet pointing is fine, but in the past

55
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.690
Danny Park: students who have a bullet pointed. They

56
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.519
Danny Park: I'm not saying, you will, but they would. They structured it so

57
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:05.580
Danny Park: they actually didn't structure it like, I couldn't follow what they're trying to say.

58
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:16.090
Danny Park: So at that point it wasn't answering a question to the expectation that a stakeholder like myself that I have. So they ended up losing points. So

59
00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:34.010
Danny Park: what I always recommend is to start with bullet points right? Just jot down the key concepts that you need to cover to answer a question comprehensively, and then, after you jot those down. Then, I would say, start to them, work through the summary, and then summary, or the narrative around it, and then submit it that way.

60
00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:48.839
Danny Park: or if you if your bullet points, if you're like, really like, really good on bullet points, and it's telling a story. And you're doing like the example we're going to go through to the mix of a summary and bullet point like, if that's if that reads, suffice, then II say, feel free to submit it.

61
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.859
Danny Park: But I'm just. I'm just sharing with you what I've seen in the past

62
00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.859
Danny Park: happened with students who took the blueprint format.

63
00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.960
Danny Park: Does that answer your question to you. Okay, perfect.

64
00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:12.620
Danny Park: All right. Walt, go ahead. Yeah. Thank you. If you started at 5 50, do you have like the full 3Â h, or is there a time limit on time limit? Full 3Â h. Thank you.

65
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:15.320
Danny Park: Michael. Go ahead.

66
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:24.799
michael amuev: hey? Good evening, Professor. So I hopped in a little bit late. I see that the exam Logistics mentions that there are 5 essay question format. Will that be the

67
00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:35.480
michael amuev: complete format of the exam, or is there anything additional choice or short answer

68
00:10:37.160 --> 00:11:03.070
Qudratullah Yousufi: man. Sorry if I'm gonna put you this, could ratula. Yeah. Professor, about the essay format. Is there any requirements? Minimum maximum words. No, no, that. And that's the that's the that's the part of the test, right? A as as Mba level business analyst, we have to be able to be very concise and comprehensive at the same time. So, in other words, communicate like a business professional. So I don't put a word limit on purpose.

69
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:08.640
Danny Park: So what that means is, however, what that means is, and I've seen students do in the past.

70
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:19.249
Danny Park: They because they didn't want to answer the question, or think through the question. What they did was, they went back to the Powerpoints and copy, and pasted everything they thought that was related

71
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:32.789
Danny Park: to answer the question. So that is not. That's not specific or comprehensive when it's not even answering the question itself as an analyst would cause it as an analyst with a if a stakeholder says, should I go into the European market.

72
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:46.799
Danny Park: and which town and which city should I? Should I make a priority as an analyst. We can't say, you know. Oh, go into Europe and then China, you know China, and they can't give them a broad answer, right? Cause? That's not what? That's not what the the question was. So when you read the question.

73
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:50.260
Danny Park: it's specific. It's a specific ask in the question.

74
00:11:51.170 --> 00:12:01.119
Danny Park: get down to the specifics, but also be comprehensive in answering that specific topic. So so I shouldn't see if I'm asking things around data quality.

75
00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:11.589
Danny Park: I shouldn't see answers related to artificial intelligence, right? Although related, I'm not asking about artificial intelligence. I don't. I'm not asking about the platform. I'm asking about the other quality itself.

76
00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:30.749
Danny Park: You could use artificial intelligence as as reinforcing a point like you need data quality of completeness to be able to train a a machine learning algorithm to get high quality, artificial intelligence that's good. But to give me a rant about artificial intelligence itself.

77
00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:41.390
Danny Park: it would be missing the mark, so I would take off some points there for not being concise or specific. And when we go over our our practice question, that will get a little bit more clear as to what I'm looking for.

78
00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:45.869
Danny Park: Does it add your question, cool your tool? Yeah, thank you. Okay, you're welcome.

79
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.809
Danny Park: all right. Any other questions.

80
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.319
Danny Park: Oh, yes, almost Mustafa

81
00:12:56.630 --> 00:13:05.220
Mustafa Afif: professor. So is it test multiple attempt, or it's just one shot it once you submitted this. Oh, yeah, once you submit it, please don't cause

82
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:12.400
Danny Park: well, blackboard will only let you submit once. I will only take your first submission. So

83
00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:21.119
Danny Park: unless some real, significant technical difficulty. I will only take the first one

84
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:26.309
Danny Park: out of fairness for everybody. Right? So ho! Hope! Hope that answered that question.

85
00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:39.879
Danny Park: Good question, though II know I know sometimes people wanna like they submit it. And then, just because they wanna be on time with it. Then they wanna go back and think about more, right? So I that that I don't give that much flexibility there in that in that perspective.

86
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:47.250
Danny Park: Alright. Well, and it because it's take home like, I'm not saying I I'm not saying anyone's gonna cheat. But

87
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:56.580
Danny Park: sometimes people talk to each other, especially at take-home test right? And I would ask everyone not to do that. I have actually never ran into that yet.

88
00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:17.579
Danny Park: But please don't do that cause people like I actually read very closely the answers. So you know, it's unless you're gonna completely rewrite what someone else wrote, I'm gonna be, you know, I I'm gonna see some similarity there. Especially being at, you know, a only a 40 to 45 member class

89
00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.620
Danny Park: second thing, please don't use chat. Gp.

90
00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:23.240
Danny Park: okay? Cause I,

91
00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:30.839
Danny Park: we have software here we run through, and it will give us a probability on if it was generated by chat or genai. Okay, so please don't use it.

92
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:38.679
Danny Park: And you shouldn't really have to use it ever. All the content that's required comes from the actual.

93
00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:49.790
Danny Park: you know the lectures. Also the way I pose my questions. It's so specific to what we covered. I don't even think Jane AI would be ready to answer it to the

94
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:52.169
Danny Park: expectation that I'm looking for

95
00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:59.480
Danny Park: right, unless because, Jenni, I wasn't trained on on our course content. Basically what I'm what I'm trying to say.

96
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:02.400
Danny Park: alright any other questions.

97
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:21.520
Mustafa Afif: Professor, you said you, we can download the question, and we can also send it to your email. That's what you said. Sure, yeah, yeah. So the the exam will be available available for download through blackboard, so people can. Just so you don't. In other words, you don't. I don't have the questions in blackboard

98
00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:32.410
Danny Park: like I hate doing that. I've done that in the past, and blackboard is just unreliable. So I just have people download it in the word format, so you'll have a word file. And just with the questions

99
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:39.510
Danny Park: you answer it on your own time, on your own local device, and then, when you're ready, you go back to blackboard. You could either use the link

100
00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:44.970
Danny Park: to submit it. because the the same link you use to download is the same link you used to upload.

101
00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:56.760
Danny Park: You either use a link, or if you don't trust blackboard, and I totally understand why some people wouldn't. You? Could email me using my Pwc address, the one on the syllabus. You could email me the exam as well.

102
00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:01.040
Danny Park: The only requirement I have for submission, though, is just a 9 Pm. Deadline

103
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:09.559
Danny Park: hunt, and I will not extend it. This is because it's just been too much, you know. Too much flexibility, too much communication. So I have to draw the line somewhere.

104
00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:19.569
Walt Black: Yeah, if we do submit it on blackboard, does it? Is it? Okay? If we email it to you just to be safe.

105
00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:26.640
Danny Park: Of course. Yup, Yup. So what I do is when I go I'll go up. I go to blackboard first. And if I see some like issue

106
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:42.370
Danny Park: or like, it's not submitted to blackboard. I go check my email so and what what you could, you could email me as well, just just for redundancy. So I'm okay with that, too. Yeah, yeah, just if it's the same copy. I understand what you say. Yeah, yeah, cool. Thank you. No, you're welcome. Awesome.

107
00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:47.309
Danny Park: alright. Any other. Any other questions.

108
00:16:51.770 --> 00:17:04.300
Danny Park: sweet, alright. So so just to before we get into the actual content. My reviews are quick. By the way, cause again, like I said, for those who join late, all, all the stuff, like everything, is transcribed

109
00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:21.289
Danny Park: on Zoom. So I don't want to waste anyone's time and resea the same thing. I just go through slide by slide. What's important to focus on. So when you're reviewing, you could skip parts of the the recording and just focus on the key pieces. So you don't have to look through. I don't know, maybe, what how many

110
00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:38.129
Danny Park: hours of content so far. 3. Now, like, it's like 27Â HA con. No, not 27Â h, maybe, I think 15 or 13Â h of content. I just too much so. So that's and that's what you see in the green here for those who join late. What you see, Green, here is the topics where I will be pulling the questions from.

111
00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:41.310
Danny Park: So that's the focus areas for the exam.

112
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:47.800
Danny Park: the light blue or gray. I'm I think I'm colorblind. Some people tell me it's people tell me that's light blue. II just see Gray.

113
00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:55.750
Danny Park: Okay, anyway. The gray boxes. I won't be pulling questions directly from those topics, however.

114
00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:07.940
Danny Park: having the basic knowledge of those of those topics, will help answer the questions on the exam a little bit more thoroughly and more comprehensively right?

115
00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:14.019
Danny Park: So just going to give you a boost and and really formulating what you want to, what you want to talk about.

116
00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:19.230
Danny Park: Alright. So let me go ahead and close this out. Let me just double check double. Make sure that I saved.

117
00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:28.479
Danny Park: Okay? And then let's go into the information system section first, the slide deck here.

118
00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:29.910
Danny Park: Alright.

119
00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:30.970
Danny Park: So

120
00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:40.080
Danny Park: this is this this part. So not this and this we don't have to worry about, so that part of the content. And I'll let you sort of just listen in on

121
00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:57.469
Danny Park: if you wanted some more, you know additional inspiration to really tackle exam question. But this is, this is the big piece right here about what the information system is. So my question is gonna be related to, you have an information system. You gotta first tell me, like what the information system is.

122
00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:07.299
Danny Park: Right? So I'm looking for a key. I'm looking for a key explanation right? And I go through it in the actual lecture. You know, I talk about how people make a mistake. They confuse 2 terms.

123
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:13.329
Danny Park: Then I'm gonna ask, you know, like what the components are like, describe the components.

124
00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.249
Danny Park: how they interact with one another.

125
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:21.070
Danny Park: And what happens if one of those components is not aligning

126
00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:39.320
Danny Park: to something else? Right? And I think I make a big make. I make a big deal about it right, and I make a big deal about it because I see it and live it every day as a technology consultant, as a operation consultant and as a risk consultant right? I wore those hats throughout my career that was like the common theme

127
00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:41.509
Danny Park: that organizations have

128
00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:48.499
Danny Park: at the strategic level was that their systems, the components of their systems was not aligned very well.

129
00:19:48.640 --> 00:20:08.970
Danny Park: There were people making decisions about a particular component without co discussing with the leaders who would run one of the other components. So it needs, it needs needs that alignment. So that's the that's where I want to focus on. So really, this slide here. And what I talk about in the recorded lecture is the big takeaway.

130
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:13.039
Danny Park: Any questions about the information system.

131
00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:16.410
Danny Park: But what I covered in that pre-recorded lecture.

132
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:28.780
Danny Park: Alright perfect. So moving on. So we covered that. Now let's go to data. Quality.

133
00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.490
Danny Park: Okay, data quality. Alright. So data quality.

134
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.709
Danny Park: Alright so. But everything here is important because it's only one slide.

135
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:41.740
Danny Park: But

136
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:46.110
Danny Park: but everything's in point. However, here's a key thing.

137
00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.629
Danny Park: one of the questions

138
00:20:48.860 --> 00:21:03.039
Danny Park: right? So my questions, the the my questions are are trying to assess. If if the students are tying all these concepts together. So when we look about that when we think about the information system, one of the components is data.

139
00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:08.560
Danny Park: right? So I might have a question that talks about data quality

140
00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:09.910
Danny Park: and

141
00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:13.380
Danny Park: the perfect answer might require

142
00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.870
Danny Park: integrating

143
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.929
Danny Park: what you know about the information system to really tackle the question at the 20 point level.

144
00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:31.199
Danny Park: Okay, so everything about about the data. This lecture here, this slide and the and the pew recorder lecture is absolutely important. I would strongly advise

145
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:34.780
Danny Park: reviewing both the information system pre-record

146
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.400
Danny Park: and the data prerecord. And think about

147
00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:42.560
Danny Park: what happens from a data quality perspective. If something will go wrong here.

148
00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:53.159
Danny Park: how that would seep into the rest of the information system and and what inefficiencies it will cause downstream, not only in the process, but also the technology, even the metrics.

149
00:21:56.220 --> 00:22:13.470
Danny Park: Okay? Because that's what business analysts do we? We have a complete picture of what the business, what the business problem is. And we focus on the best solutions. Because we have a holistic view of the actual. If that information system not just the information technology.

150
00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:19.920
Danny Park: alright. Any questions here related to data.

151
00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.510
Danny Park: data quality and things like that.

152
00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.749
Danny Park: Alright good. And what's next? And we have.

153
00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:35.199
Danny Park: So I'm not gonna cover the data models and the database manager systems like

154
00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:41.629
Danny Park: cause. Usually read the let. Just listen to lecture on your own time and just figure it out. There's nothing to focus on there. Okay.

155
00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:47.119
Danny Park: let's go to strategic business analytics. So I'm gonna plug

156
00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:51.149
Danny Park: that slide deck in a moment. If my laptop wants to

157
00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:56.709
Danny Park: work, come on. Alright.

158
00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:00.179
Danny Park: So business analytics. Okay, so

159
00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:02.680
recording.

160
00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:05.969
Danny Park: So so and say something.

161
00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:17.130
Danny Park: Okay. I think we just so much didn't go on mute. Okay? Oh, all good. Alright. So this slide is very important.

162
00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:22.830
Danny Park: Okay. we have to understand what strategy is

163
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:28.359
Danny Park: right. And it gives you the definition. We have to also understand

164
00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:29.710
Danny Park: how

165
00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:37.409
Danny Park: Ops project and product, how they all interrelate with one another.

166
00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:46.150
Danny Park: Okay, and how analytics is a pervasive thing that that goes across these 3.

167
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:59.459
Danny Park:  I call them enablers to success, right? Or the pillars. Right? So it goes across these 3 pillars and analytics is what like that keeps these these 3 things aligned.

168
00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:10.219
Danny Park: Okay? So we talked a lot about these slide 9 and 10. During our actual lecture, which is recorded, I would highly definitely encourage

169
00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:15.900
Danny Park: to understand slides, not intend, because they will be a question related coming out of there, without a doubt.

170
00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:29.849
Danny Park: Alright! And then that's that's pretty. That's pretty much it. Like we could, you guys, you guys could read the rest of this just get inspiration. But the big, the big focus on is going to be these 2

171
00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.500
Danny Park: strategic planning executive.

172
00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.449
Danny Park: what is strategy? And then strategic planning, executive management.

173
00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:42.190
Danny Park: Alright

174
00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.990
Danny Park: any questions related to this.

175
00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:53.300
Danny Park: So, as I'm talking, you might don't. Please don't misunderstand like Oh, I don't have to review a lot.

176
00:24:54.270 --> 00:25:02.850
Danny Park: My quest again my questions. Tie these things these things together, right? Like, for example, on strategy. If you don't have a really good data strategy.

177
00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:13.670
Danny Park: right? Well, for example, if well, let's begin. If you don't have a good strategy meaning you don't understand what strategy is, then you can't have a good data strategy. If you don't have a good data strategy. Whether there's an effect

178
00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:27.459
Danny Park: right? It's gonna affect something, right? It's gonna affect data quality. If something is wrong with either quality, then your information system is off. And if your information system is off, then you create all these other inefficiencies. So my questions are like, it's it's that in depth.

179
00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:32.599
Danny Park: So what I mean by comprehensive? That's what I'm talking about. But within these concepts

180
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:35.979
Danny Park: the question is asking something specific.

181
00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:42.209
Danny Park: So within these concepts, would it bring together what's relevant to answer that specific question.

182
00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:48.209
Danny Park: So specific and comprehensive is the expectation to answer a question, to get 20 points

183
00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:59.879
Danny Park: alright. So switch you did. We did that then. Now let's go to machine learning and artificial intelligence.

184
00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:14.330
Danny Park: This slide. So slide 2 slide 3, not really tested because it is historical

185
00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:17.500
Danny Park: concepts. Right? Slide 4 will be tested.

186
00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.430
Danny Park: Well, it would test a meaning.

187
00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:26.589
Danny Park: We will have to understand it, to be able to bring it into, bring it into our

188
00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:35.210
Danny Park: knowledge areas to be able to answer questions. So machine learning steps are very important. We don't have to worry about this because this is another view of Slide 4,

189
00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:42.969
Danny Park: slide 6 will not be tested like it. Just it was just showing, you know, like it was just stressing the point

190
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:44.440
Danny Park: of how

191
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:49.259
Danny Park: things are machine learning, how are how machines learn?

192
00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.110
Danny Park: Right? As basically based on the business problem.

193
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.719
Danny Park: Right? Slide 7, 8 and 9,

194
00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:58.140
Danny Park: you need to focus on it.

195
00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:04.680
Danny Park: I have to understand what like the differences between this th. These 3 learning models

196
00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.070
Danny Park: don't need 11

197
00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:14.539
Danny Park: don't need 12, don't need 13 need 15,

198
00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:24.460
Danny Park: and I remember throughout this lecture recovered the concerns as I was speaking right? So

199
00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:34.860
Danny Park: just PE just pay attention to to the concerns that I raise. I think I also at the end, did cover this slide again. So just to recap slide 4,

200
00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.559
Danny Park: slide 5. No, I'm sorry. Slide 4, slide

201
00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.290
Danny Park: 7, 8, 9,

202
00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:50.340
Danny Park: and then 15. Okay, so slide 4, slide 7, slide, 8, slide 9,

203
00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:53.180
Danny Park: and then

204
00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:55.740
Danny Park: slide 15.

205
00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:14.010
Danny Park: Okay, so as example, not that this question is gonna like. Not that this type of question will be on the exam. Like to tie it all together. You know I could ask a question. You know a a company is starting to build. They're starting to build their artificial Intelligence platform that does XY and Z.

206
00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:21.340
Danny Park: And as they're building, they're creating, they're finding a lot of inefficiencies in the way there are. Their platform is learning.

207
00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:26.519
Danny Park: What are the main reasons that could be causing that inefficiency.

208
00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:41.180
Danny Park: So when we think about it that that question, although it might seem very like, Well, what is he talking about? Let's go think, just think about the con, the topics we we covered. Right? We talked about data quality. We talked about information systems we talked about

209
00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:58.570
Danny Park: and infrastructure everything else. So knowing all that right and then knowing what it takes to actually do a, the learning machine learning steps, we could start answering the question as to, Oh, yeah, if you're having inefficiency around creating an artificial intelligence platform. Well, here are all the things that might be wrong, right?

210
00:28:58.670 --> 00:28:59.690
Danny Park: And then

211
00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.490
Danny Park: you go and answer that question.

212
00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:13.570
Danny Park: Okay, so I won't. I won't give it away, because, you know, that's part of the exam. But that's that's how we have to think about again. Like my, the content. I'm covering. These, all things relate to each other.

213
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:21.179
Danny Park: They don't live in their separate silos. So that's why I hate multiple choice questions, because multiple choice questions, it forces you.

214
00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:27.140
Danny Park: It forces you to only learn things in silos. but in the business world

215
00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:35.400
Danny Park: for those who future consultants out there we can't give answers and silos. The answers our clients expect are very. We have to be comprehensive and specific.

216
00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:46.619
Danny Park: So part of the exam is is assessing your ability to bring in all the knowledge that you have gained develop a story that's specific, comprehensive, which is going to answer the actual question drive value.

217
00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:56.200
Danny Park: Sorry. I really hate multiple choice questions. I feel that's a very disservice to to grad students undergrad. Maybe

218
00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:57.600
Danny Park: right?

219
00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:10.220
Danny Park: Because Lya Undergrad is like you. You should like. They don't know anything so like making them memorize things is okay. But at the graduate level, what we expect from Mbas training, you guys on multiple choice questions absolutely fails. You guys when you guys go through interviews.

220
00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:23.300
Danny Park: anyway. Hello, little Rant there. Sorry about that. I don't know if anyone knows me like have seen me like participate on Brook, on campus, like events like that's my whole. I'm very passionate about making sure that Bruce students are prepared for interviews.

221
00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:28.140
Danny Park: cause that's the only thing I see that Burgers deficient and is, is training students how to actually get to interviews.

222
00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:30.610
Danny Park: And I firmly believe the way they test.

223
00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:39.189
Danny Park: Anyway. Sorry offer ants. You could skip that part of the review recording. All right. So we're good here. Any questions around machine learning.

224
00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:41.660
Danny Park: And AI,

225
00:30:44.800 --> 00:31:11.010
michael amuev: yeah, Professor.

226
00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:19.380
Danny Park: I'm just bombarded with that training all day every day. Alright. So next one deep dive and data strategy. So this is this is my

227
00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:23.309
Danny Park: who my day to day it gets. It gets messy. But

228
00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:25.409
Danny Park: we got to figure this out

229
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:30.899
Danny Park: not just as a company, but our whole and our entire business world has to figure this out.

230
00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.199
Danny Park: So data strategy. This

231
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:36.799
Danny Park: is important. This will be tested.

232
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:42.120
Danny Park: The question that's related to data strategy is gonna seep. It's gonna require

233
00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:50.199
Danny Park: good understanding of the other kind of of the other topics that we just talked about right? Because data strategy is the comprehensive thing that

234
00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:54.590
Danny Park: that that it's either gonna make you pass or fail

235
00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:56.940
Danny Park: everything we talked about

236
00:31:57.030 --> 00:32:05.479
Danny Park: from building. Building an AI platform to training your machines to making sure your data quality is good. Make sure your information systems align

237
00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:13.559
Danny Park: companies right now, waking up and understanding that they'd never had a data strategy because they didn't understand what strategy was. In the first place.

238
00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:17.100
Danny Park: right, I mean, when. But you know, that's the strategy slide, right?

239
00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:25.120
Danny Park: It'd be surprising at how many. And this is something I realized as I was growing up into more senior roles. How

240
00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:41.259
Danny Park: we assume that top level executives, that all of them understand what strategy is, and I would tell you not all of them do only the best of the best understand what strategy actually is right, because many of them who got into executive roles, they got their

241
00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:47.800
Danny Park: in a different path right? Not all of them were strategists who got into executive roles. So.

242
00:32:48.250 --> 00:33:00.649
Danny Park: really understanding how to carve out strategy, will first understanding understanding what strategy is, and then be able to carve out what that means and apply it to the entire value chain of organization.

243
00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:02.250
Danny Park: including

244
00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:07.290
Danny Park: the information system. That's what makes us separates the best from everyone else.

245
00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:11.239
Danny Park: So definitely review everything here.

246
00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:17.369
Danny Park: right? Focus on the data life cycle. This is something that people forget

247
00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.270
Danny Park: that they don't understand

248
00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:24.889
Danny Park: that everything that we do right now in information, in, in, in industry 4 point

249
00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:32.110
Danny Park: right now, where we're building AI, everything that's happening with generating new data at a light speed

250
00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:36.170
that has impact

251
00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:44.839
Danny Park: to knowledge, to analytics, to strategy, to infrastructure, to cost.

252
00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:47.820
Danny Park: to talent models, to global

253
00:33:48.450 --> 00:34:04.520
Danny Park: government reactions, to automation. It has a complete impact. So we have to understand that data cycle is a is a thing, although invisible. It's the. It's a thing that's the most pervasive that we're not. We're not paying attention to.

254
00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:09.049
Danny Park: Okay. Now, I'm emphasizing data lifecycle. But like I said, all of these are important.

255
00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.790
Danny Park: right understanding. Each

256
00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:17.300
Danny Park: is gonna help us really bring together

257
00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:22.339
Danny Park: right? And this slide 10. It call like, and and it culminates with its slide. 10.

258
00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:28.980
Danny Park: This is going to be a future for all, and maybe it's a strong statement. But I firmly believe this.

259
00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:39.240
Danny Park: Your careers for those in this room newly minted, and, Mbas, you will. You will make a name for yourselves in data.

260
00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:51.350
Danny Park: right? It's and I don't mean engineering. I mean just the several different knowledge areas that we have to understand about data.

261
00:34:52.139 --> 00:34:57.179
Danny Park: right? It's collection. It's transformation, it's transmission.

262
00:34:57.250 --> 00:35:10.619
Danny Park: It's translation. right? It's it's cleansing. It's loading right? It's storage. All that stuff for everything. I just listed. Each is its own career path.

263
00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:21.430
Danny Park: So there's a lot of opportunity for everyone in this room to carve out a great career in data, because all the firms are focused on it. Average, I can't name one that's not.

264
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:27.430
Danny Park: And by firm, that's like about the fortune 500, like, if you're mom and pop shop like you're, you have different problems, right?

265
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:34.039
Danny Park: But if you're 14500, especially the force, 100, the everything's data right now.

266
00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:39.639
Danny Park: So definitely definitely review this. All the slides are important. Any questions.

267
00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:43.550
michael amuev: Yeah, Professor, if I may.

268
00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:44.669
Danny Park: Yeah, go ahead.

269
00:35:44.700 --> 00:36:08.129
michael amuev: So I actually had a question regarding this lecture. When I watched it there were different components of it. There was the 3 pillars. Then there was the 7 principles, and then there was the components, and at the end. It's the slide that you have up, which is the signs of a poor data strategy. I just wanted to understand. Where? Where do the 3 pillars. I guess it's not related to the exam, but more to the lecture and of itself.

270
00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:32.699
Danny Park: But where do the 3 pillars that you talk about in the beginning of that lecture. How do they apply? Are they more important than the 7 principles? Because I felt like there was some overlaps within the governance. Yeah, yeah, no. There, there is a lot of overlap. So a data strategy, great question, a data strategy is is specific to the organization, right? Depending on depending on what the company's business is.

271
00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:45.980
Danny Park: You're gonna prioritize. One component of your data. Strategy needs over another. Like, if you're a like, I'll just use this. For example, if you if you are, let's say Mana.

272
00:36:45.990 --> 00:37:14.779
Danny Park: Meta, or Amazon, right? And you have blistering amounts of data flying back and forth, and you and the. And then you're leveraging your data infrastructure to actually deliver services right like Amazon knows to bring me my stuff and time because they're storing that data, and they're able to provide a surfaces to some other mechanism or some other node in the company. So for them, I'm making sure that my architecture, my data models is best in class, and I'm gonna get away with. If some of my other components are not as good because I my cost is a constraint.

273
00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:23.210
Danny Park: right? And my time is a constraint. So I could only focus on 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 one place. So when we talk about when we think about data strategy. Right?

274
00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:31.910
Danny Park: What you what you see here, or whatever version you see, is just the basic foundation knowledge areas that we have to be considering.

275
00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:42.880
Danny Park: But once we get into an organization, we start understanding what business they're in, we start custom tailoring the components and prioritizing what needs to be surface to the top versus the others.

276
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:45.940
Danny Park: Does that? Does that answer your question like, does that?

277
00:37:46.010 --> 00:38:02.609
michael amuev: Yeah. So that helps me get a more clear understanding as to the the component aspect. You're saying that the the business and depending on their needs, they're gonna focus on different components. But how do we tie that in with the 3 pillars that we mentioned. I understand how the how the 7 principles apply

278
00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:10.399
michael amuev: and how the errors might be based back to the 7 principles. But where do the 3 pillars exactly have a role in that.

279
00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:29.479
Danny Park: Let's let's take it. Let's take it offline cause there's like my thoughts. I have a lot to talk. I don't wanna go into election. Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah. So let's let's do. Yeah, you should email us to office hours that make sense. Is that okay? Okay, cool, cool. Thanks, Mike. But I appreciate the questions I just, I just want to do right by you and not.

280
00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:36.389
Danny Park: and and just set set up some time to really go through that. But great question, though. Yeah, alright, thank you.

281
00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:40.690
Danny Park: Alright. And any other questions.

282
00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.660
Danny Park: All right. Any

283
00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.240
Danny Park: anyone still concerned about the exam.

284
00:38:55.810 --> 00:39:02.599
Danny Park: Yes, no. Raise your hands. It's okay. Like it. Just, I think the reason why? I asked, because I okay, good. Good. Thank you for being honest.

285
00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:06.560
Danny Park: It's okay. It's it's it might seem

286
00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:08.900
Danny Park: scary. But

287
00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:13.990
Danny Park: it's really not like people do very well in my exams.

288
00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:20.580
Danny Park: They really do. So let's let's go into a practice question. And hopefully, this kinda

289
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:22.020
Danny Park: helps

290
00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:33.729
Natalliaâs iPhone: lessen the fears or the anxieties around take can be practice. Actually, I looked at the prost practice practice question as we started the lecture and made me more scared. Oh, really.

291
00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:53.270
Danny Park: I don't know if I'm alone. Well, good good news is. This is probably, if I were to say, if this is easy question first harder question, this is probably one of the harder questions I would that I put on by put on an exam. So, okay, good. So

292
00:39:53.370 --> 00:40:01.379
Danny Park: the practice question. So this again, is the question that I asked in the past. And the answer, you see, was actually an actual answer provided by

293
00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:12.949
Danny Park: a students. Okay? So the practice question, you are a business consultant helping your client create a robust and value dripping data strategy. Right? So what I'm thinking immediately is, my mind is on

294
00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:23.420
Danny Park: the data strategy lecture. It's like as the first concept, I need to start using to gain inspiration to answer this question. So that's where my mind is going to be. Okay.

295
00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:39.549
Danny Park: Okay, then it goes. The Cfo asks you. Right? So some chief executive officer, right of finance right in this case is finance asking me what is data quality and a significance to business operations. How would you respond to provide a comprehensive answer?

296
00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:41.850
So what this student did was

297
00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:47.630
Danny Park: in a bullet point slash like hybrid summary format. First

298
00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:55.199
Danny Park: answered. what is data quality by using the components. which is a fantastic approach?

299
00:40:55.370 --> 00:41:03.240
Danny Park: Right? So it's answering the first part, remember? Comprehensive. Okay? So she? She dissected the question

300
00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:25.440
Danny Park: and started to use it, to start to provide the answer to each, to each part of the question. Okay, it was great analytics here, like going through the question and analyzing it, to understand what needs how it needs to be answered, to get 20 points right? And, by the way, like she was the only one that got 20 points. There's several got 20 points. This was just the most. This one was the one that impressed me the most

301
00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:28.340
Danny Park: out of out of all of them. So she

302
00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:31.279
Danny Park: first did the components

303
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:33.780
Danny Park: and set and describe them

304
00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:41.930
Danny Park: right, because the Cfo's asking, it's like, hey? This is accuracy, and refers to that, and conformity refers to this and that. Consistency refers to that

305
00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:43.390
Danny Park: perfect

306
00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:49.730
Danny Park: on the exam. They're they're. I remember this question. They're students who just ended there.

307
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:54.650
Danny Park: Right? So wasn't comprehensive. Didn't answer the second part

308
00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:58.220
Danny Park: of the question the Cfo asked.

309
00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:00.520
Danny Park: Okay, so

310
00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:07.119
Danny Park: the highest they got was 13 points. By the way, I don't fail people. I don't believe in failing people.

311
00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:23.089
Danny Park: especially at the grad level, unless you really, really, really like deserve it like, I don't feel anybody. But they got 13 points. So they still at that. 13 is like, I think, like a like a 65 or 70 out of that right? So the worst, the worst you get is like 13 points on a hundred question, unless you really really muck it up

312
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:25.370
Danny Park: right? So.

313
00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:36.110
Danny Park: But this answer was answering the significance. Say, Hey, Data Act. Accurate data is crucial for business operations because it forms a foundation of informed decision. Making

314
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:41.129
Danny Park: and aggregated can lead flawed and analysis, misguided strategies

315
00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:50.579
Danny Park: and financial losses, for example, inaccurate sales, figures can result in incorrect revenue, forecast impacting budget allocation, resource planning so

316
00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:52.100
she

317
00:42:52.270 --> 00:43:00.080
Danny Park: explain the significance, but also referenced. How it impacts or can influence strategy. Just in that alone.

318
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:10.579
Danny Park: We covered all this. She didn't use anything. What was not in the she used everything that we talked about in lecture. This was fantastic, and you see, it's not that much writing

319
00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:25.080
Danny Park: so specific. It was comprehensive, it answered what was asked about in the question. There's no rant for anything else. There's nothing in here where she added things that did not relate to what she was trying to tackle in the question.

320
00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:29.270
Danny Park: This was a pure, high class.

321
00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:36.060
Danny Park: and analyst answer. and then she followed that with every single one of them.

322
00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:38.490
Danny Park: Right?

323
00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:45.509
Danny Park: Here's another one. So consistency ensures that data is uniform and follow standardized formats and conventions.

324
00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:52.200
Danny Park: Right? Consistent data simplifies data management, reporting and analysis. So she referenced the data management system.

325
00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:56.699
Danny Park: I recognize that extra like in my mind, like awesome

326
00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:03.079
Danny Park: inconsistencies, such as variations in date formats of product descriptions, can lead to errors and misinterpretations.

327
00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:08.730
Danny Park: Consistent data promotes clarity and reduces the risk of miscommunication and operational efficiencies.

328
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:13.010
Danny Park: She referenced the the product project and operations

329
00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:17.150
Danny Park: high class answer.

330
00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:23.959
Danny Park: okay, and then so on and so forth. So definitely take a look at how this was answered

331
00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:30.300
Danny Park: right? And take note that

332
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:35.879
Danny Park: the person really really was thoughtful and and like really analyzing the question

333
00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:45.020
Danny Park: right? So she had to account for what the client wanted to do. and also had to account for what the Cfo asked.

334
00:44:46.910 --> 00:45:01.540
Danny Park: So where did some go wrong? So I already referred. I already provide an example. What what some students went wrong was, they only answered a part of the question. Right? So I will say that's the most common theme of of student answers. Not getting full points is because when they look at the question.

335
00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:04.749
Danny Park: They don't actually answer the whole question. They're not comprehensive.

336
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:11.729
Danny Park: It's like they pick, they add. They read the question. and then their mind goes to what they want to answer.

337
00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:25.759
Danny Park: and then they list their answer. But here you're not answering for yourself. You're answering for the Cfo. And for your client. So as analysts, we have to give the answer that they want, we can't give the answer that we think

338
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:29.700
Danny Park: they want. We want. and that comes to

339
00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:41.190
Danny Park: understanding the business problem. So each question on the exam is the business problem that you, as analysts, have to solve in a specific, comprehensive, and articulate way.

340
00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:50.060
Danny Park: That's what these my tests are testing you on. And, by the way, your interviews have the same format.

341
00:45:52.660 --> 00:46:05.260
Danny Park: So if you can answer the questions posed to an interview, and you dissect the questions and analyze it. And you give the interviewer exactly what they're asking for in a comprehensive, specific way. You're going to get that job

342
00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:11.860
Danny Park: for those who fail to do that. The hiring manager's gonna go. I have no idea what this person's talking about.

343
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.160
Danny Park: They just ranted.

344
00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:24.999
Danny Park: And then you get chosen over the other candidate. Okay. so this. any questions around like this?

345
00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:30.709
Danny Park: Does it provide some clarity around how to tackle an actual question.

346
00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:46.520
Natalliaâs iPhone: Yes, I just hope not. All of them. Are this loaded? No, no, no, this is like I use. II provided, like the the, the the most, the the most loaded one I could think of to provide it as example

347
00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:51.390
Danny Park: to cover all the bases. But not there's. There'd be questions on the exam that are not as loaded as this one

348
00:46:51.440 --> 00:47:02.410
Danny Park: like this will be the question that's gonna separate the A's from the A minuses and b pluses. or everyone could just do a great job. And everyone gets haze like, you know, that's it. Yeah.

349
00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:14.450
Danny Park: So I'm looking at the so a new professor. All these points are just the answer for that question.

350
00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:20.139
Danny Park: Okay, can I? Can you? Can you clarify anoop? Wh? What do you mean? What do you mean by that?

351
00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:39.289
Natalliaâs iPhone: I think he's trying to ask, or she she's trying to ask if this is the answer to one question which was my concern, making sure not all of them. Are this loaded? Oh, yeah, yeah, these are. Yes, these are. These are all the.

352
00:47:40.110 --> 00:47:42.730
Danny Park: But if you think about it, it's not that much

353
00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:55.480
Danny Park: right? We just hope that we won't have to write 5 pages. No, no, no, no, it's it's it's I promise it's not that. It's not like that.

354
00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:59.580
Danny Park: It's it's there's gonna there's gonna be a question

355
00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:06.019
Danny Park: that's similar to this, that so all questions, like all exams.

356
00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:09.240
Danny Park: there has to be a question that's used as a separator

357
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:26.280
Danny Park: between, you know, the ones who actually like understood the material, who who applied their rigor and discipline to study, and, you know, ask the right questions things like that, and then everyone else, just out of the fairness of what Brew calls a greeting policy. Right? But

358
00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:34.490
Danny Park: even on interviews you would never get a question like this or similar like this, unless you're actually going for an operation.

359
00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:35.729
Danny Park: How'd you consulting role

360
00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:40.559
Danny Park: like those roles require you? In fact, those questions are so high level

361
00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:42.910
Danny Park: that

362
00:48:43.010 --> 00:48:53.170
Danny Park: they're testing to see how much knowledge you actually know about that. That, you know, answering that pride, that business problem. And they want to stay there assessing your complete knowledge base

363
00:48:53.470 --> 00:49:04.820
Danny Park: as a as a consultant. So those are actually very difficult. So so this is just one example. Hope it kind of clears it up just like I said, one question will be like this, the others will be a lot less, not as loaded.

364
00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:08.310
Danny Park: Okay. But, Mike, I saw you had a hand up. I don't want to ignore you.

365
00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:36.250
michael amuev: Sorry. I just kinda wanted to ask. So the way the student approached this question was by identifying all the components describing the components and then in indicating what their significance is, would an appropriate response, maybe be in a similar fashion, so identify all the components what they are. And then, at the very end, after you identified all 6 components, just write like one or 2 sentences implying their significance in in a in a general consensus

366
00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:52.500
michael amuev: like, how would you grade that? Would that be a sufficient answer? Do you want it? Each each component. What is it? And it's it's significance. No, no, no. So what you said is is is on the right track. Because, like I said, this was the one that impressed me the most.

367
00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:57.349
Danny Park: There are other students who answered it differently, who still got 20 points

368
00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:59.800
Danny Park: right, but I just wanted to show

369
00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:08.100
Danny Park: the one that was the most impressive, and how they tackled and analyzed the question, where? If? I'm sure? Yeah, you know what I mean? If I'm showing the top of the mountain.

370
00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:09.300
Danny Park: Then.

371
00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:27.129
Danny Park: you know, and not everyone has a clamp to the top like you'll know exactly where to go. You know what I mean I didn't want to give like the like, the worst of the best answer. And then people like start dropping the ball right because I didn't give them the full clarity around like what the best can look like. Does that make sense? No, thanks, Mike. Yeah.

372
00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:32.309
Danny Park: alright. Any any other

373
00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:37.669
Danny Park: questions. And this is already posted on blackboard.

374
00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:41.589
Danny Park: So you guys, you guys, you guys already have access to it?

375
00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:49.199
Danny Park: We have a full week before the exam, like I said, like. If there's any questions around

376
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:51.170
Danny Park: the, you know.

377
00:50:51.360 --> 00:51:04.350
Danny Park: like exam, you want the office hours. You want to talk through anything anything else. I think I already spoke with a couple of people about the career path around like business analytics. I think that business analytics, the strategic lecture exactly more specifically

378
00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:07.370
kind of got people thinking about like oh, like

379
00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:23.759
Danny Park: like, Oh, what's the MB. Like? Now? I know what I want with my Mba. Before. Like many people, may many people kind of choose, not many. That's strong word. Some people choose to get the Mba. Thinking of the Mba degree. That degree itself is what helps you transform careers. When that's not the case.

380
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:26.240
Danny Park: What you what you

381
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:31.950
Danny Park: focus on during your Mba experience is gonna help you discover

382
00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:36.239
Danny Park: where you want to go. No one hires anyone for their degree.

383
00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:41.279
Danny Park: No one doesn't. We don't. No one cares what degree you have actually

384
00:51:42.050 --> 00:52:05.039
Danny Park: what we care about during interviews. We're assessing. If you want to do the role you're actually interviewing for world class companies like mine and Deloitte and and I've worked for a few. All our interview. Our focus area for interviews is, does this person actually want to do this role? Do they actually want to work for Peter Deloitte and all of our questions, although it might not seem obvious. That's what we're assessing for.

385
00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:10.880
Danny Park: because the theory is, which is a good one is that if you know why you're in that room.

386
00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:18.799
Danny Park: and you know why you want to work for that company. Every time you answer a question we give you, it should be specific and comprehensive, and to the point.

387
00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:30.039
Danny Park: If it's not any of those right, you are there, faking your answers and hoping that you put the veil, or you you you you blind us to where we just happened to choose you.

388
00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:44.910
Danny Park: So I want during my my this course and also my extracurricular work. I do at Baruch with students. I'm trying to helping them get through that idea that as hiring entities that we don't recognize that because we actually do

389
00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:57.010
Danny Park: right and has nothing to do with your Gpa. Or how smart someone is, or what school they went to? It all comes down with. Did they give the answers? That was genuine because a genuine answer is comprehensive, specific

390
00:52:57.600 --> 00:52:59.020
Danny Park: to what we're asking for.

391
00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:06.780
Danny Park: right? So anyway. So I have a little rant hope that was helpful, if not my apologies, any questions around anything we covered

392
00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:10.249
Danny Park: about the exam. It's a logistics.

393
00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:16.779
Danny Park: the content where to focus. And the question. Leslie. Oh, go ahead. Yeah.

394
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:20.139
Leslie Vides: that's good. Yes, when would you be posting the

395
00:53:21.590 --> 00:53:31.919
Leslie Vides: the what? The exam? No, no, no, the the recording, this recording. When would you be posting it as soon as zoom

396
00:53:31.970 --> 00:53:34.410
Danny Park: like tells me it's ready. I'll post a link.

397
00:53:35.290 --> 00:53:36.859
Leslie Vides: Thank you. You're welcome.

398
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:44.180
Danny Park: Any any other questions.

399
00:53:45.440 --> 00:54:05.810
Donald Rada: I saw someone else go off mute. Sorry if they? Wanna yeah, it was me, Professor, I was just wondering. Has there been a case for a student? I know it's based. But has there been any student who included a photo or an image on their response. And I was wondering, how how do you feel about that?

400
00:54:06.550 --> 00:54:11.139
Danny Park: I am okay with photos as long as there is

401
00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:12.600
Danny Park: like.

402
00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:21.880
Danny Park: I've seen it in the past, and I'll give a good example and a bad one. This is a really good question. I had one give you the photo.

403
00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:26.660
Danny Park: but just a photo. And the photo itself

404
00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:32.450
Danny Park: was like, including things that were not related to the question.

405
00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:35.249
Danny Park: So I had no idea what he was trying to tell me

406
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:51.250
Danny Park: so because I had nobody. What I was trying to tell me. It didn't satisfy the comprehensive specific. So start to lose points again. I didn't fail like, I didn't get like a 0. Right? I think I gave like a 13, right? Yeah, usually 13 is in my low, like II rarely remember going lower than 13

407
00:54:51.330 --> 00:55:06.550
Danny Park: I did before, but I just forget why I did. But 13 is usually my like lowest, I go unless you don't answer if you don't answer giving a 0. So so please answer the question. Don't like not answer, just thinking, I get straight. 13 and past the exam. That's not gonna happen.

408
00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:24.180
Danny Park: So the the other good ones use the photo, describe the part of the photo that's relevant to what what the answer is, and then gave a little bit more specific, and bringing in some other content, so as long as again. Like, if it answers the question specifically and comprehensive, there's good detail around it. I don't care.

409
00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:31.399
Danny Park: But I just hope it's not like a collage. or you know, or mosaic

410
00:55:31.650 --> 00:55:38.099
Danny Park: of things, or or or word spaghetti like, you know anything. But does it answer your question? Sorry.

411
00:55:39.310 --> 00:55:43.590
Donald Rada: thank you. I was just hoping to like kind of help

412
00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:52.050
Donald Rada: kind of give a full picture. I mean, I'm very open to people using it. If they feel like it's going to add on

413
00:55:52.330 --> 00:55:57.979
Danny Park: and you know, sometimes sometimes people you know, they they show better than tell.

414
00:55:58.490 --> 00:56:06.879
Danny Park: I highly recommend. I recognize that right? So so I would say you people use, you know, everyone can use their judgment, provide pictures. But

415
00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:13.389
Danny Park:  yeah, well, let's see how it goes. But it's fine. But

416
00:56:13.850 --> 00:56:15.810
Danny Park: let me, I was gonna say something.

417
00:56:17.130 --> 00:56:18.109
Danny Park: Oh, yeah.

418
00:56:22.210 --> 00:56:31.430
Danny Park: it's the the exam, is not that overwhelming? Right? And I know it feels overwhelming because and

419
00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:33.240
Danny Park: academically.

420
00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:45.169
Danny Park: what's what what has happened right? Including myself growing up. And our education system is there. It's so they're so they're so keen on giving multiple choice, right?

421
00:56:45.670 --> 00:57:06.879
Danny Park: But like, I said, like my the intent of. So I'm I'm meeting the purpose of the Mba program. The purpose of Mba group program is because students are great getting the Mba. To be ready for the business world. I really take that seriously, and I respect every student that decides to wants it to pay tuition and get an Mba. Because I want to adhere to that right.

422
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:19.710
Danny Park: I provide essays because essays in this format is practiced to get people ready to tackle interviews and find success. No one cares about your Gpa.

423
00:57:20.070 --> 00:57:23.879
Danny Park: No one cares, no one goes and says, What Gpa do you have there to interview

424
00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:31.780
Danny Park: right? Even your gpas. No one cares unless you're in like high class, like high net worth investment banking.

425
00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:37.429
Danny Park: Outside of that. No one's gonna use your Gp as an assessment to see if you can into G and get into view or not.

426
00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:42.510
Danny Park: Right. A 3 and a 4 to an hiring manager is exact, same.

427
00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:53.400
Danny Park: What separates people is their resume, their experience, how they spent their Mba experience, what they actually did in a thoughtful way to get the wisdom they need to figure what they want to do and how they actually interview.

428
00:57:55.320 --> 00:58:12.249
Danny Park: Okay? So the fear might be, and I'll just go on like an assumption, and I'll and I'll end my rant and we'll end for the night if they're unlisted anymore. Questions, right? Most of the fear comes from the fact that most Mba students are so focused on Gpa. The only thing that they care about is like, oh, my God, I might bomb this, or it's gonna hurt my Gpa.

429
00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:18.469
Danny Park: right? So I'm not sure what to hurt. The Gpa. Means, because getting an A

430
00:58:18.490 --> 00:58:25.530
Danny Park: and a B in one class or in classes doesn't impact the Gpa. To a point where it's going to make you get a job versus not get a job

431
00:58:26.490 --> 00:58:37.400
Danny Park: right? Let's say you get an A in one class, and you get a B plus another right? The the change in your Gpa is like minuscule. So let's say, instead of 4.0, you end up getting a 4 point a 3.6.

432
00:58:38.010 --> 00:58:42.679
Danny Park: As far as your application is concerned, a 4.3 point 6 exact same thing

433
00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:53.019
Danny Park: as long as like a 2.3 like, unless you didn't bomb your Mba program because Mba programs a higher Gpa standard as long as you didn't bomb that standard you're gonna get.

434
00:58:53.030 --> 00:59:06.450
Danny Park: You know, if your resume is right, you're going to get an interview. So reason why I go through this is because I'm trying to help with the fears cause the fears in my, in my experience as an educator, as being a prior student. All that comes from the fact that it's

435
00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:08.680
Danny Park: what's my Gp, gonna be

436
00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:29.679
Danny Park: right. So I just I just want to share that. It's your your Mba experiences. For especially those first years. Your Mba experience be so much more valuable if you take a step back and realize that your Gpa. Is not the priority. It's what you're at, where you're spending your time and making business connections and being thoughtful about how you want to go and answer questions.

437
00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:36.689
Danny Park: including in networking. Because if an executive asks you a question, and you rant. They're not going to give you any attention anymore.

438
00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:53.020
Danny Park: Right? So just please be appreciative of of being challenged by essay based questions, because that's how the business world works. No client goes. I have a problem. Here's a multiple choice exam.

439
00:59:53.810 --> 01:00:02.200
Danny Park: No, I promise you no client will ever do that. and no hiring manager ever do that. No interview process will ever do that will give you multiple choice.

440
01:00:03.810 --> 01:00:08.339
Danny Park: Right? So hope that helps calm the fears about about

441
01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:10.200
Danny Park: the exam.

442
01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:19.170
Danny Park: And that Gpa, although it's it's you need to, you know. Still, like Pass. It shouldn't be the priority.

443
01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:20.860
Danny Park: Do the best.

444
01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:24.479
Danny Park: and we'll go from there. Okay, any questions

445
01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:26.170
Danny Park: on anything so far.

446
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:33.000
Danny Park: Alright. if not.

447
01:00:33.570 --> 01:00:45.379
