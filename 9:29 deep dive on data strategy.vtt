1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.809
For

2
00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:13.780
Danny Park: all right. So data strategy. So let's let's tackle this. This is I I I I live This I think I mentioned last time I I live in this stuff the today. Um! It's. It's pretty exciting,

3
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:23.189
Danny Park: so hopefully that could share my excitement, and it's not too boring as I go through this. But before we get into data strategy we're going to go into some concept that we already covered.

4
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.729
Danny Park: And the good thing is, we covered

5
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:34.020
Danny Park: basically all the major concepts that we need to be be very aware of as we are building out a data strategy from

6
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.540
Danny Park: provisioning

7
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:47.759
Danny Park: to implementation. Okay, So Let's go through those slides. Let's go to the reminder slides. I like to call them really quickly. So first reminder slide is the big B's. We always have to keep this in our minds when we talk about data.

8
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.370
Danny Park: In fact, data at any level,

9
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.560
Danny Park: be it strategic leadership or tactical,

10
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.889
Danny Park: we have to be talking about or thinking about um,

11
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:12.819
Danny Park: the the big V's: Okay. So i'm not going to go through it again, but just to just keep this in mind when I start, talk about the data strategy. Okay, so big these one of them we have to keep really close to our minds as we have this discussion,

12
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.910
Danny Park: right? So the next concept,

13
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.020
Danny Park: our framework is going to be around the data life cycle.

14
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:27.820
Danny Park: Okay, So Big V's: and also the data lifecycle, right? We talked about this, too right? We talked about how data is not only

15
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.130
Danny Park: um

16
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.709
Danny Park: acquired a collective from a company, they do

17
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.390
Danny Park: things with that data,

18
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:46.349
Danny Park: and they based on the things that they do, we what we call data transformation or data wrangling. It creates additional different types of data that we share downstream.

19
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.490
Danny Park: Okay, So let's keep this close to

20
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.709
Danny Park: uh mind as well as you talk it through.

21
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:09.559
Danny Park: All right. So then, next slide. Let's go to now the architecture. Okay. Now let's Now we don't have to know the details of

22
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:24.219
Danny Park: big data, architecture, right? And data models, right as as those on the leadership side. We don't necessarily have to be in the details of things. We just have to have to be aware of all the ingredients that we need to to realize

23
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.659
Danny Park: or maintain an actual architecture. Okay, so

24
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.960
Danny Park: just to i'll quickly recap this, because, you know, there's a lot going on, and and

25
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.019
Danny Park: I think it's been a while since we last talked about this. So

26
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.329
Danny Park: the architecture it's collecting data from several different sources, right? Which ties back to our

27
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.630
Danny Park: Our. V's. The big V's.

28
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:56.660
Danny Park: Then the data is collected and based on the desired outcomes we want from the data

29
00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.139
Danny Park: which ties back to that data strategy we'll talk about soon. We do things to that data.

30
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:10.769
Danny Park: Right? So in this we call it data pre-processing, or the terms for it is data transformation or the terms for that is, data wrangling

31
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:28.470
Danny Park: right or some other terms for the same concept pre-processing transformation uh wrangling there's a new term now, which is called data ingestion. Okay. So if you hear those terms. Just understand that you're taking the raw data from the sources, and you're doing something with them

32
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.959
Danny Park: based on a specific business

33
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.250
Danny Park: purpose or a desired outcome.

34
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:43.410
Danny Park: Then, after you start preparing and getting that data, you're going to put it into your data model, right? We talked about how data models

35
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.380
Danny Park: these are These Are

36
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.680
Danny Park: their schemas

37
00:03:49.690 --> 00:04:09.110
Danny Park: right? Just think of like an excel table, And these are the something These are things that we have to plan as well. Right is that there's a separate. This is part of the data strategy. So before we really talk about where we're going to get the data and what we're going to do with it. We have to figure out, hey? We have to be able to store that stuff right? So, for example, we gave last time was that if we're collecting revenue

38
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:24.580
Danny Park: as a data point, but our data model doesn't have a column for revenue. Right? Let's use again. Let's use an excel table as the easiest example to understand this right? If the excel table doesn't have revenue, then how can we get it in? How do we store it. We can't.

39
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:31.639
Danny Park: We have to have an area or a column that's going to capture that data for cold revenue.

40
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.089
Danny Park: Right? So data model is very important. We have to have the model.

41
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.620
Danny Park: Then, once you have the model,

42
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:53.670
Danny Park: then we could start parsing out the different data sets for the different purposes that we discussed earlier, right? So if we wanted a set of data to do some analytical work, we're going to have a a subset,

43
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.100
Danny Park: or in this instance, data set one. That is a subset of the larger data model,

44
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.569
Danny Park: right? And data set two which is a subset of the same data model

45
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.439
Danny Park: it's going to be, for it looks like some type of machine learning

46
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:23.529
Danny Park: algorithm and another data set here for another type of machine learning. Algorithm right? Then we publish those and we talked about the machine learning model that would sit in between here before it gets published. But the point here is this is that this data model here

47
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.220
Danny Park: what we call a common data model.

48
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:35.240
Danny Park: So right now, in many leading organizations, it's the race to see who can create a common data model

49
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.619
Danny Park: that can be used to service

50
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.489
Danny Park: right, all of the downstream business purposes

51
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.830
Danny Park: and technology applications. Okay,

52
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.710
Danny Park: And then

53
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.610
Danny Park: and between that big data architecture. So we call this. The data operating model

54
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.240
Danny Park: for data. Ops: right

55
00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:14.419
Danny Park: right in this this term. Calls it. Did it announcely. I hope you guys get the point, though. Like to be honest in technology, these things are really simple common sense. But there's so many terms running around the flying around the same thing. People think it's like they don't know enough. But to be honest, like people know, plenty

56
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:32.540
Danny Park: is that people are making that other people from different places of the world are making them do terms for the same concept. So this this, this image is calling it data analysis, layer, but in reality we call it data. Ops right, or data flow or data flow operations, whatever the company wants to call it.

57
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.590
Danny Park: What's the point here, though?

58
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:47.089
Danny Park: Right? We notice that there are two layers that sit on top and below, or, in other words, supports this operating model. First one is the governance layer, so in other words, governance it. Governance.

59
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:56.390
Danny Park: Right. Governance means Um, the risk man, You know, we all know what governance is really So basically the risk management side of data. So, for example,

60
00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.639
Danny Park: and the easiest example is to use this regulations right? If there is data.

61
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:05.760
Danny Park: Um,

62
00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:08.640
Danny Park: let's use a

63
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.900
Danny Park: It's just test example. So this

64
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:20.719
Danny Park: there's a type of data called fifty six hundred and seventy-one category, fifty, six, seventy. One says that that data

65
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:31.519
Danny Park: is, protect the data that cannot leave the United States. So if there is a us entity working on with that classified data or classification of data,

66
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:39.319
Danny Park: they can outsource it as send it to some offshore location. So, for example, let's say a governor. A A company has an operating model

67
00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:47.029
Danny Park: where part of the work it gets done in. Let's say, um Singapore,

68
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.769
if that if that work

69
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:56.730
Danny Park: that's done in Singapore requires seventy-five to seventy-five, sixty-two data.

70
00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:13.069
Danny Park: That's bad right So so I made a mistake, because you can't send that data over to Singapore which means that you can't do that process because you don't have the data for it. So the governance that rule that exists governance ensures that rules and other risks

71
00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:31.420
Danny Park: are captured, so they don't enter the data pipeline, because if seventy, five, sixty-two data, fifty I keep saying if you numbers, I I forgot what the number is i'm gonna go with fifty-six fifty-six, seventy-two. I'll stick to that if fifty-six, seventy-two data makes it into the data operating model

72
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.379
Danny Park: let's say it's ex in the comedy of the model,

73
00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:36.500
Danny Park: and someone by mistake

74
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:42.870
Danny Park: sends a portion of that, puts it into a data set and sends that to to Singapore.

75
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:48.089
Danny Park: That company will get in trouble once they get audited at the data level,

76
00:08:48.520 --> 00:09:01.340
Danny Park: right? So they broke a bunch of laws. It is a huge fine. So what the governance layer does, is it? It produces several different types of rules that you could embed into the operating model layer

77
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:09.799
Danny Park: that when the system comes across that type of classified data in this, in the in the common data model it will prevent you from actually sending it to offshore location.

78
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:15.419
Danny Park: So that's why the governance layer. One example of why the governance layer is very important,

79
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.240
Danny Park: right?

80
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:37.339
Danny Park: The other layer is a persistence layer. So this layer is dealing with massive storage so big data storage because it can you imagine the size of this common data model that services multiple different business purposes? So that's going to get sorted somewhere, and it also includes the data services. So when you're moving data around from one

81
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.640
Danny Park: from one application to another,

82
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:53.289
Danny Park: or from one middleware to a end system, or even collecting data from one platform to your ultimate. Let's say that you ultimate. But let's say your your um data wrangling engine,

83
00:09:53.300 --> 00:10:07.590
Danny Park: right? All those activities are done by this persistence layer which includes those services. Right services, means that it's It's it's. It's providing that capability to move data from one place to another, and doing some type of processing on it.

84
00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:17.699
Danny Park: So we have to keep this in mind as well. This what I just explained not remember, not in too detail, but just understand what we mean by architecture and data models.

85
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:25.240
Danny Park: Okay, So we have three. We have three things. So far we have to keep in our minds as we talk about data strategy. So now let's get into data strategy.

86
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:31.140
Danny Park: So what is data strategy, right? And people always have this question around like, What is it so?

87
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:39.399
Danny Park: Luckily we talked about it already, right? So we talked about the three concepts. But here's the other concept. We talked about right people process data, technology. What's that?

88
00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.570
Danny Park: That's our Sis information system components,

89
00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:48.469
Danny Park: right? We also have to keep that in mind. And we talked about how, if there is misalignment in one component,

90
00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:57.550
Danny Park: it has a ripple effect against another. And if there is misalignment in the components, it's your strategy will fall apart.

91
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.469
Danny Park: Okay. So a a quick example of

92
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:10.369
Danny Park: a data strategy related uh information system component alignment would be, you know, if let's go back to here. All right.

93
00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:15.649
Danny Park: Let's: I will use a a data set to um

94
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:19.740
Danny Park: people component. So we have a data set, and

95
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:27.460
Danny Park: one of our business purposes is to take data sets and feed it into a unsupervised learning model.

96
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:42.540
Danny Park: Right? Well, sure, if we had a technology and the data to do it, that's fine. But we also need the subject might experts. We talked about machine learning how this a lot of context and other things are not captured in the data sets.

97
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:52.549
Danny Park: So we need to make sure that we have the right person in place who's going to facilitate the the effective and efficient learning of whatever model or platform we're trying to teach.

98
00:11:52.630 --> 00:12:09.429
Danny Park: So if there's a misalignment between the people and the data right, we Don't have what we want. We don't get to desired outcome. So our strategy, our strategy of, for example, in this example, creating an application that does some artificial intelligence right would not be met.

99
00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:14.129
Danny Park: So that's why you see here when we talk about the data strategy,

100
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.479
Danny Park: there's three main pillars

101
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:29.199
Danny Park: to the core data strategy. There is a data governance strategy, right, which includes people and process. So when we go back here, this governance layer includes process

102
00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:43.900
Danny Park: right, meaning that, hey? If this is fifty-six, seventy-two data, the process is to check to see who the ultimate receiver is, and if the receiver resides out on outside of the United States, prevent that data from leaving

103
00:12:44.770 --> 00:13:01.470
Danny Park: right. So that's a process, even by a rule, a governance rule so process. And then the people Well, we need the people who understand the business regulations to help us build those in. So, for example, if we don't have the right people who don't understand

104
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:11.869
Danny Park: sharing data across territories and the rules around them, then we won't be able to build that rule. If we don't have that rule because we don't have the right person, we don't have the right process and then go ahead. It creates

105
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:12.920
Danny Park: risk.

106
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:16.489
Danny Park: We get fined and our data strategy falls apart.

107
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.330
Danny Park: Okay,

108
00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:36.240
Danny Park: So that's one teller, The other pillar is data analytics. So we have to have a strategy around how we go into collect data and how we're going to transform it. And that means we have to get a better understanding of what types of data to collect

109
00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:43.599
Danny Park: what technologies we need in place to transform them to get it into our common data model.

110
00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:44.780
Danny Park: Right?

111
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:50.089
Danny Park: So those are the two pillars that are heavily involved in the data analytics strategy pillar.

112
00:13:51.190 --> 00:14:04.209
Danny Park: And the third pillar is a data management strategy pillar. Right here, again, it's data technology. But in our infrastructure model. Here the data that we're cared we care about at the data level is the storage

113
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:07.819
Danny Park: and the management and the governance. So these two layers up here,

114
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:14.019
Danny Park: Governance and the persistence layer is what the data management strategy

115
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:18.499
Danny Park: pillar is. So these three strategies together

116
00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:20.419
Danny Park: when they are

117
00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:27.600
Danny Park: put together in an integrated way. That's what we call data strategy. So what do I? Why do I bring this up?

118
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:33.129
Danny Park: I've heard, and I've heard this mistake many times,

119
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:44.549
Danny Park: especially, you know, sometimes from some even technology and business leaders who don't, who don't understand what not. They don't understand, but they have an incomplete picture of data strategy

120
00:14:44.740 --> 00:15:00.730
Danny Park: sometimes that people talk about data strategy. All I hear them talk about is the governance side, and they go. Oh, that's our data strategy. I go. Well, no, it can't be a data strategy because you just have governance. What about the data analytics, indeed? Imagine because those two other pillars are going to help you figure out

121
00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:07.299
Danny Park: the rest of your architecture that you need. You have to ask those questions. You can't just ask about the governance. What about all this other stuff that happens

122
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:15.220
Danny Park: right on the on the flip side. Sometimes I hear people say, Oh, i'll data strategy is, and they share something, but It's only residing in pillar, too.

123
00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:20.640
Danny Park: So okay, you have. You have the mechanism down here, the persistence layer. But okay, what are you? What are you doing

124
00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:25.929
Danny Park: like, What's the what are you trying to do? What's the point of having an empty envelope,

125
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.210
Danny Park: if you that I put anything in the envelope,

126
00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:30.499
Danny Park: or you don't know what to put in it. What's the point?

127
00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:32.230
Danny Park: Right?

128
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:42.549
Danny Park: So when we talk about building out a data strategy, we have to. First I a good way to start. What I used to do in the day when I was building these out

129
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:44.949
Danny Park: is I would have

130
00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:51.120
Danny Park: just literally a a a document that has these three pillars side by side,

131
00:15:51.170 --> 00:16:03.850
Danny Park: and across the three pillars I would have like, Imagine one, two, and three as three pillars, and then across them I would have people process data and Texas across all three of them,

132
00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:23.589
Danny Park: and that would help me frame up as i'm talking about and think about all the ingredients I need from a people perspective. Um! Keeping in mind that I have to make sure that the people I am looking to use or identify to build up my governance. I mean my my data strategy. I'm making sure I am getting the people who have governance expertise.

133
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:30.769
Danny Park: People who have data analytics, expertise. People have the data management expertise because this day and age because it the the tech stack,

134
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:36.960
Danny Park: it's so voluminous, and we'll talk about the tech stack in a couple of weeks right in our last session.

135
00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:40.700
Danny Park: It's so voluminous.

136
00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:46.110
Danny Park: You have to really get specific as to who you really targeting

137
00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:55.589
Danny Park: right? Because, like if you're a Microsoft enabled company, right? You're gonna want a specific type of experience to handle your data management and storage If you're running Microsoft Suite

138
00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.540
Danny Park: right? And usually with Microsoft, you're running the actual end to end.

139
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:03.060
Danny Park: Architecture ops right. So it's

140
00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:21.810
Danny Park: doing that really helped me like stand out when it came to showcasing my strategic thinking right? So three pillars, data, governance strategy, data, analytic strategy and data management strategy as a three pillars. And I would line process people tech data across. I'll start filling in the ingredients

141
00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.849
Danny Park: to make sure I have. The whole is the picture of what I need.

142
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:25.910
Danny Park: Okay,

143
00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:28.040
Danny Park: any questions. So far,

144
00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:29.850
Danny Park: what I'm covering.

145
00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.170
Danny Park: All right, let's keep going

146
00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:42.439
Danny Park: right. So that's data strategy, which is the the the the integration of the three pillars. Okay,

147
00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:56.610
Danny Park: then, the next thing we have to keep in mind, right? So for so for keep memor, keep continue. Keep these on your mind in in your minds. Okay. The next thing of this is asking ourselves is okay,

148
00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:07.669
Danny Park: what? What are the best practices, or what are the core principles that I need my data strategy to align to to make sure

149
00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:09.260
Danny Park: that I have a

150
00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:27.730
Danny Park: a very foolproof, protected and actionable strategy. Okay, And these are seven principles that I have used in the past to build up my strategy. And this is really It's really helpful, right? So some of these are redundant, but the parts that are redundant is because those are the most important.

151
00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:35.749
Danny Park: All right. So first one is governance right to develop a program, to ensure compliance of key step in the data life cycle.

152
00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:45.159
Danny Park: So when I would see when I let's say I go back to here. I'm building out my data strategy right? I'm thinking through it from these three pillars when I get to

153
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:50.099
Danny Park: the people side at the data governance strategy piece, I'm trying to ask myself, Okay,

154
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:57.089
Danny Park: what are all of the different governance rules that will affect me

155
00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.529
Danny Park: right, based on

156
00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:02.790
Danny Park: the business problem trying to solve

157
00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:09.129
Danny Park: right? So if i'm trying to build, let's say, for example, i'm trying to build a tax technology

158
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:12.590
Danny Park: right for a a global.

159
00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:18.740
Danny Park: So let's say, for a global conglomerate who needs to file taxes in multiple jurisdictions,

160
00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:19.890
Danny Park: right?

161
00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:29.460
Danny Park: The easy example for that governance would be. Oh, I need someone who understands the actual tax data

162
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:49.659
Danny Park: and governance rules will go go in and meaning the governmental rules of each of the Territories that I want to sell my application in. So, for example, if my tax application is meant to do a corporate tax return for a German company. I need to understand how Germany's data rules apply,

163
00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.909
Danny Park: and also what their tax rules are,

164
00:19:53.850 --> 00:20:01.379
Danny Park: and so on and so forth for all the other territories that I want my platform or my tax technology to service.

165
00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.509
Danny Park: Right? So I have to have that principle in mind of okay, Governance

166
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:10.280
Danny Park: means holistically driven by a business purpose. What are my rules?

167
00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:12.330
Danny Park: Right?

168
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:17.959
Danny Park: Then? That's again naturally feed it into my second principle of data content, right

169
00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:23.550
Danny Park: in my tax technology platform. I don't want to collect data that I don't need

170
00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:26.659
Danny Park: right. I'm trying to tax.

171
00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:30.180
Danny Park: But then why would I collect social media data?

172
00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:32.160
Danny Park: I don't need to

173
00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:40.290
Danny Park: right. So I have to understand the data content. I'm: actually that's going to make my business

174
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:45.040
Danny Park: purpose, or or des that outcome satisfies

175
00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:59.040
Danny Park: all right. So now, once I think about the governance rules. Right? So I know all the rules there in place I have to divide by. And now I have an understanding of just the specific type of content I need to collect.

176
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:05.079
Danny Park: Then that's when I start thinking about. Okay, how do I ensure the quality of that data

177
00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.420
Danny Park: for my tax and Ija platform

178
00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:16.030
Danny Park: right like How? How? What's the last of the data coming in? Right?

179
00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:29.939
Danny Park: What different types of files can I expect? Right? Our client our clients gonna want to do Pdfs and or Semi-pdf, Send me email, send me excel files. What are they gonna send me stuff in or do I want to put a limit behind it.

180
00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:42.769
Danny Park: How do I check for system veracity? So how do I know that? How do I? How can I get the application to check for data accuracy as it collects it as it processes it right. So i'm

181
00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.679
Danny Park: thinking about all these big v's,

182
00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:56.829
Danny Park: and finding a way or trying to solution away to make sure that the platform I'm building is going to make sure that my quality is my data that comes in. The system is of good quality.

183
00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:03.409
Danny Park: So after I talk about that and have that principle

184
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:09.610
Danny Park: pushed upon, the next principle of the data strategy I have to keep in mind is that Well, the data that I collect in my platform

185
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.510
Danny Park: in my system,

186
00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.380
Danny Park: right? It has to be a set as accessible

187
00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:20.730
Danny Park: right. But data access right is not just talking about?

188
00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:24.009
Danny Park: Is it available for people to to

189
00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.210
Danny Park: get to acquire?

190
00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:36.150
Danny Park: But is it in a format in a way that's understandable to them right. So each example would be this: Let's say, my text technology platform collected all the data

191
00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:40.049
Danny Park: right? And it's presenting it to stakeholders.

192
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:46.359
Danny Park: Would it make sense to present that data and literally bits and bytes like ones and zeros.

193
00:22:47.340 --> 00:23:02.730
Danny Park: Or let's say I, a German opens my tax system to read that, you know, get access to tax data, and for some reason the translation I did have a translation thing, a mechanism in there, and it was presenting it in French, not German.

194
00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:09.870
Danny Park: So data is accessed, sure, but it's not understood.

195
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:15.099
Danny Park: So that's a very important principle of the data access to principle

196
00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.740
Danny Park: all right.

197
00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:21.550
Danny Park: Next one is obviously data management,

198
00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:30.680
Danny Park: right? So going back to my tax technology platform, we kind of talked about this which relates to governance is, if let's say, let's say,

199
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:32.469
Danny Park: a Us. User

200
00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:36.150
Danny Park: has a set of data that's fifty, six, seventy, two,

201
00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:39.920
Danny Park: and then the person trying to send it to the German counterparts.

202
00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:50.360
Danny Park: Right? That systems data management, the platform, I mean the tech tax analogy platform should prevent me from sending, should be able to look the metadata

203
00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:53.239
Danny Park: at the data I'm sending, and the metadata

204
00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:55.839
Danny Park: shows that it's fifty, six, seventy, two.

205
00:23:56.020 --> 00:24:03.610
Danny Park: Then the platform should go. Okay, Who is Danny trying to send this to? Oh, it's a German entity and the system, the platform should say no,

206
00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:06.520
Danny Park: and then block it. So there's data management going on

207
00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:16.740
Danny Park: right. The next principle of data strategy would be that the data that you are presenting

208
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:26.460
Danny Park: or that you're you're using the bar with data strategy it has to be. It should be able to to inform decision making.

209
00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:28.330
Danny Park: Okay.

210
00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:31.470
Danny Park: So you imagine the information system capability.

211
00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.859
Danny Park: So that's another principle a did. This strategy needs to have

212
00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:39.079
Danny Park: who abide by right.

213
00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:43.560
Danny Park: And the last one, obviously is analytics.

214
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:53.769
Danny Park: So when I when I was building out my data strategy after i'm building out, you know the three pillars and the and the systems components across that, filling out all the ingredients

215
00:24:54.360 --> 00:25:05.629
Danny Park: the entire time, as i'm. Built, as i'm, on building up the ingredients and staffing and and thinking of ways to um execute on it. I'm always referring, referring

216
00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.690
Danny Park: to these seven principles.

217
00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:13.279
Danny Park: Right? I'm asking myself, Okay, I I have. I have the people, and I want to put this process in.

218
00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:19.279
Danny Park: If I put this process in. Is this process going to ensure data quality

219
00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:24.309
Danny Park: right? Is it? Is it going to um

220
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:37.199
Danny Park: be able to be accessible so like everything that you do when it comes to planning out your data strategy across the the information systems you always have to ask yourselves these questions as it relates to that particular

221
00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:40.819
Danny Park: activity or or

222
00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.469
Danny Park: a component trying to build in.

223
00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:52.040
Danny Park: Okay, very important. And so again, i'll stop here for any questions. Anyone have any questions.

224
00:25:54.100 --> 00:26:01.319
Flamur Mjeku: I have a question. Um! It seems like there's a a a lot of lot of these activities

225
00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.429
Flamur Mjeku: uh that we have on a on our principal data strategy.

226
00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:09.890
Flamur Mjeku: Now let's say if that entity in Germany

227
00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:18.479
Flamur Mjeku: wants to translate their data from English to German right. Would that impact the data system?

228
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:31.080
Flamur Mjeku: And uh, what is this? I mean, What are the uh of activities that need to follow, to to translate that data from English to German, so

229
00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:43.239
Danny Park: do they have to go through the governance first, like. No, no, it depends it it no your it it. It depends on the rules and Regs related to the data. So, for example,

230
00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:50.199
Danny Park: translation by itself is fine. But what the governance people would say, what I would ask is okay,

231
00:26:50.290 --> 00:27:05.769
Danny Park: let's say it's fifty-six. The It says six hundred and seventy-two data. My my question would be hey? So Governance also has a place a business purpose, I would say, Hey, it takes time and money to translate things to German. What's your business purpose behind translating data that a German person should never be reading

232
00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:17.320
Danny Park: right, and if they can't justify that cost or business purpose as to why that translation should happen, then as a data strategy, it should be like. No, we're not going to do it,

233
00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:29.849
Danny Park: because that defeats the value of of the stress. So they data the data strategy. And ultimately, where these seven principles, it's safeguarding the value of it,

234
00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:36.520
Danny Park: and also the scope of what you're trying to do. Because if you don't, stick to, or if you don't have these seven principles, you

235
00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:46.739
Danny Park: one, you might definitely be breaking some laws or doing some activities that Don't generate value from that strategy because a strategy gives birth to implementation

236
00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:48.090
Danny Park: So

237
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:51.430
Danny Park: and so i'll go into how this relates

238
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:54.839
Danny Park: the day to day that work that you guys do at work.

239
00:27:55.950 --> 00:28:05.960
Danny Park: I would. I would say that some of you what you're working on. You have no idea what you're doing. You have no idea how it's generating value. You just doing it to collect the paycheck, which is fine. That's not your fault,

240
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:12.039
Danny Park: but from an organization strategy, perspective. I would say that's a very concern to me, because i'm like Okay,

241
00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:20.490
Danny Park: my strategy be a data business. Whatever a strategy means. You have these principles and frameworks and all these other things in mind,

242
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:25.090
Danny Park: because collectively, when you think and integrate them.

243
00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:27.870
Danny Park: You're increasing the value

244
00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:37.690
Danny Park: to real the realization of solving that business problem. So the idea is that when you have a value-driven strategy,

245
00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:46.269
Danny Park: you're going to create all these different implementation of projects or operations based on your core strategy. So in theory,

246
00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:51.430
Danny Park: the more your strategy is maximizing value

247
00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:57.369
Danny Park: through the integration of these frameworks and principles. Then, whatever you're executing on

248
00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.629
Danny Park: right is already focused on

249
00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:02.170
Danny Park: toward,

250
00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:13.430
Danny Park: you know, maximizing the value for the organization. So i'll just jump to my last slide to kind of show this, you know. I will touch upon it after and flammer. Thank you for that question, right?

251
00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:21.820
Danny Park: This is how we should be thinking about all these concepts, And this is how our mind should be thinking about as business leaders. We go okay. We have frameworks.

252
00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:28.969
Danny Park: I know in the Nba program, because you know, frameworks principles all the time. But you know, when I was going to the Mba program to be honest with you.

253
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:36.459
Danny Park: Excuse me, I'd be honest with you normally tied that stuff to with me. No one really tied all that stuff up for me,

254
00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:50.890
Danny Park: so I go here, the principal, and that was it like I'll read something memorized. And here in my principles i'm like I don't know how this relates. But you're asking me in abu dhabi e form. What is the principle of Yadda? Yadda yadda, i'm going to go, Amy, in the meeting my email, and pick D.

255
00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:53.560
Danny Park: But if you ask me, hey,

256
00:29:53.780 --> 00:30:01.769
Danny Park: this principle of Xyz, how it relates to the overall business strategy of the finance and transformation market for Goldman Sachs, i'm gonna go. What the hell are you talking about?

257
00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:12.840
Danny Park: Because no one tied it together So the way this way that these things tied together is famous and principles, are you? They're They're framing up a a a point of view in your mind

258
00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:18.439
Danny Park: how to really structure understand the principles behind

259
00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:22.500
Danny Park: something. And in the business world. It's a solution,

260
00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:27.580
Danny Park: right? Because you want to build solutions here. These are the implementation steps to build solutions.

261
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:33.409
Danny Park: So you So you go. Okay, Here are the principles that I want, based on all the frameworks that I know that exist

262
00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:52.739
Danny Park: based on real things like the the big data, the these those are real things, the data life cycle. It's a real thing that data architecture. It's a real thing. So as a business leader for me to understand strategy have to know what these things are and how they relate.

263
00:30:53.040 --> 00:31:05.909
Danny Park: So when I know, how do they relate? I know what my principles are meaning. What's the what are the things that I need to abide by? What's my like? I guess, in the religious sense, what are my ten commandments?

264
00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:16.360
Danny Park: She'll never murder. I shall never covet. I shall never like those are your principles, because I know that if I abide by them i'm good. I'm safe

265
00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:24.810
Danny Park: right. And also if I aspire to emulate all of them together. I'm going to go to heaven

266
00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:39.659
Danny Park: again like I know loose analogy, but hopefully, that makes sense for some sorry I don't know why I got into like really just stuff. But hope hope you guys are understanding this right? So I know that if I bide by all the seven principles I, or or at least believe in trying to make them work.

267
00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:43.050
Danny Park: The strategies I create

268
00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:48.910
Danny Park: are already walking on water, but in other words, going back to our release analogy. They are good for heaven,

269
00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:51.530
Danny Park: the maximizing value.

270
00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:56.890
Danny Park: So, since they already meant structure to maximize value

271
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:12.090
Danny Park: in in business theory, all of our projects and activities and things that we do need to align to that strategy. So if our strategy is of good principles and they're already maximized, value. Anything that I possibly can do is Holy

272
00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:26.379
Danny Park: Mike just going back to a religious analogy. Let's say, Jesus, You know I just got to pick Christianity. Jesus lived by Principal the Holy of Holy. Anything he did was of perfection. No matter what he did, He was bringing people back to life.

273
00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:32.919
Danny Park: So that's what it means to align your tactics to your strategy

274
00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:46.430
Danny Park: that that strategic building it's same for any type of strategy, right? So a good challenge for those in this class would be. If you're doing a day to day,

275
00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:55.550
Danny Park: and you have no understanding of why you're doing it, and how that ties to your strategy. I would I would probably argue to you

276
00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:59.980
Danny Park: that the strategy wasn't really built on the rigors of principles,

277
00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:11.519
Danny Park: and those principles, if any, were not tied to realistic like reality things. Because how many times have you guys worked on things where you work on it also? And you realize that? Oh, My God! I don't have what I need to work on it.

278
00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.339
We'll push it to the next step.

279
00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.150
Danny Park: Well, because

280
00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:18.969
Danny Park: they weren't based on real things,

281
00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:25.150
Danny Park: and if they are based on real things, they were an integrated, and the student have to build principles off of them.

282
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.830
Plummer: It does answer your question. Yeah,

283
00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:33.520
Danny Park: Yeah, it is. So. Thank you.

284
00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:35.209
Danny Park: All right. So

285
00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:38.919
Danny Park: So now let's go into. So now you have the principles. Right?

286
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:42.750
Danny Park: Then we have what's called

287
00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.570
Danny Park: the data strategy components.

288
00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:51.520
Danny Park: Right? So you have a data strategy working on data strategy. And, by the way, a data strategy

289
00:33:51.630 --> 00:34:00.899
Danny Park: or anything strategic, it's done in iterations. That's why the agile mindset and the four values of agile. It's another framework that we should keep in mind. I don't have it here,

290
00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:03.549
Danny Park: but that's something that we need to keep in mind.

291
00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:12.549
Danny Park: Okay. So a data strategy you have, like a good skeletal framework of the principles. And you're like, Okay, I You know what I'm. Good. Let me start going into the components.

292
00:34:12.739 --> 00:34:17.209
Danny Park: The components are the things that you need

293
00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.269
Danny Park: to start

294
00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:21.659
Danny Park: structuring

295
00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:32.440
Danny Park: should be good enough to solve

296
00:34:32.659 --> 00:34:42.229
Danny Park: will give you an idea of how to approach several different business problems that's facing the organization. So from my data strategy, perspective, right,

297
00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:45.139
Danny Park: there are three main

298
00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:54.959
Danny Park: right now they're more, but they're three main desired outcomes that many corporations are looking for in their data strategy. Right? There are three things.

299
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:56.690
Danny Park: The first thing is

300
00:34:56.730 --> 00:35:10.830
Danny Park: right. It's obvious. And we talked about this before is, how do we stand up or create a machine learning or artificial intelligence mechanism? Right? In other words, How do how we need to build products

301
00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:17.120
Danny Park: that solve business problems, leveraging, leveraging, machine learning and artificial intelligence? Right?

302
00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:20.740
Danny Park: So that's one design outcome of a data strategy.

303
00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:27.920
Danny Park: Another outcome of the same, of a data strategy that many organizations have is

304
00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:43.920
Danny Park: hey? In our ecosystem of technologies and our tech stack, there are so many different applications. In fact, some of our team members are using multiple technology platforms to do their actual day to day job.

305
00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:48.650
Danny Park: For example, our project that's going on.

306
00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:50.970
Danny Park: So

307
00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:59.180
Danny Park: what strategy do we need to have in place to streamline the downstream data consumption?

308
00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:03.099
Danny Park: Right? So if you see here like, hey, how do we streamline this

309
00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:05.060
Danny Park: the collection ingestion,

310
00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:08.920
Danny Park: and get our a common data model

311
00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:16.119
Danny Park: to make sure that we don't have fifty different technologies. That's being fed by one common data model

312
00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:18.629
Danny Park: because

313
00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:19.919
Danny Park: and

314
00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:24.230
Danny Park: data life cycle framework.

315
00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:28.760
Danny Park: Each of these technologies are creating more data that we have to house.

316
00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:33.989
Danny Park: So if each platform is creating data

317
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:42.790
Danny Park: and all fifty platforms that say fifty of the data that they create. So as the fifty platforms, fifty of them create redundant data,

318
00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:46.100
Danny Park: all that redundant data

319
00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:57.550
Danny Park: is being captured and stored in a persistence layer. So how much waste? Lean six, Sigma, How much waste is in our persistence layer today.

320
00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:59.760
Danny Park: So you see how wastes

321
00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:01.689
Danny Park: you create one

322
00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:05.609
Danny Park: that waste, will. It's like It's like What do you call it?

323
00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:09.569
Danny Park: What's that name of that movie where it's like a Little Fuzzy

324
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:21.469
Danny Park: Garrett. I'm gonna I'm. I'm. I'm, i'm. I'm actually thinking of you right now. It's a little funny like Fuzzy Little Yeah, I'm Nicole you you took. You took Garrett's throne

325
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:43.630
Danny Park: so so it's like they're like freaking Gremlins like you. You have one waste, and it just like multiplies and feeds others right So we just talked about how, hey? You don't. You have fifty different applications.

326
00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:48.820
Danny Park: But then we know that a real thing called a data life cycle is creating more data,

327
00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:52.619
Danny Park: a real thank hold it persistently as capturing that data.

328
00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:57.419
Danny Park: Then. Now we created more waste of of of capturing it. So over processing

329
00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:58.680
Danny Park: um

330
00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:04.239
Danny Park: over storage, right inventory. In other words, right. All the stuff is happening.

331
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:10.580
Danny Park: That's all because there is a data strategy. It's not. That's not thinking holistically through. Everything

332
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:21.729
Danny Park: so hopefully, i'm kind of shedding I'm peeling the onion back on data strategy a little bit to understand. Hopefully, everyone gets it in this class that every single one of you in this class are qualified to be strategists.

333
00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:27.520
Danny Park: The only difference between you and I that you didn't understand what all this jargon meant

334
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:31.819
Danny Park: right, and no one just showed you how to tie these things together.

335
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:39.919
Danny Park: And in fact, in business, in this bit, in this industry that we call capitalism. I would argue to you that very few people know how to tie these things together,

336
00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:54.179
Danny Park: all right. So So the components right? So So we talked about. So we talked about machine learning

337
00:38:54.480 --> 00:39:11.770
Danny Park: as a business, as a as a business uh as a des outcome. We talked about streamlining applications as another business outcome. That's last business outcome. So they're more. But i'm gonna give the main three right now. That's hitting industry right now where we we're We're Ceos and Cfos. It's just like God damn it!

338
00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:17.019
Danny Park: So I want to help us with this stuff, right? The third one is, it actually leads to common data model

339
00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:29.800
Danny Park: right here, because i'll explain to you why, if there's some company out there who could ingest massive amounts of data and be able to create one common data model. I can service entire entry alone. Every the company on this planet will go away an instance

340
00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:31.430
Danny Park: period,

341
00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:38.219
Danny Park: all right. So Microsoft is. Microsoft is working on this heavily, heavily invested in this

342
00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:43.389
Danny Park: I'm. Trying to figure out a universal data model for specific industries,

343
00:39:44.410 --> 00:40:08.870
Danny Park: because their idea is, Hey, if we understand the industry and us, and we have a common data model that can service the entire industry. And we just have to go to the data sources. Then all these companies. We're building all these other products that are competing with us. We can get them out of the way because we have seamless data integration to our one technology that's going to feed off for that one industries data

344
00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:12.460
Danny Park: that will do the analytics and machine learning everything else.

345
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:20.450
Danny Park: So that's a that's on people's minds right

346
00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:30.819
Danny Park: is certainly so. Those are three main business problems. So what's the data? Strategic component? So what what it is is? So we have these three main business problems, right or desired outcomes

347
00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:40.179
Danny Park: a component? Is these components fit into that base, that that that that that that that that that that that outcome

348
00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:56.020
Danny Park: to give some structure around it. Right? So let's take uh the machine learning one, for example. Right? Say we A. It is our outcome. We want all of our data strategy is to be able to build a machine learning artificial intelligence platform. Okay, So what do we need? We need a business case,

349
00:40:56.850 --> 00:40:57.680
Danny Park: right.

350
00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:03.099
Danny Park: We need to see what the goals are. Okay for that machine learning, algorithm, What's the goal?

351
00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:12.080
Danny Park: What are you trying to do? What industry, what function are we trying to get into what's What is our little goal for that specific solution?

352
00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:17.680
Danny Park: Okay, What's the roadmap like? How? What? How are we going to build it? What are the requirements?

353
00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:21.639
Danny Park: Right? What are the features? What are the functions?

354
00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:27.540
Danny Park: When is it going to be released to the market? What's the role map for this platform to hit hit market

355
00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:32.049
Danny Park: right? What are the risks? And so success factors

356
00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:39.970
Danny Park: of not only building toward this platform, but once it hits the market. What does our risk of success look like?

357
00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:44.589
Danny Park: Right? How much is going to cost us?

358
00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:55.209
Danny Park: What metrics do we want in place to measure against our desired goals for that particular business, you know. Problem or solution, right business, I mean desired outcome.

359
00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:00.110
Danny Park: All right. What team do we need to get that going,

360
00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:14.030
Danny Park: and the background will be, What's the background behind the justification behind this that adds up in the business case. So the data strategic component as you're writing these things out. They have to. What aligned to what

361
00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:16.259
Danny Park: the principles

362
00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:20.300
Danny Park: you don't just write a business case on a whim.

363
00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:27.060
Danny Park: If you just write a business case on a whim. How the hell do you know It's on strategy?

364
00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:29.129
Danny Park: How

365
00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:34.140
Danny Park: But guess what? How many business cases are in out there?

366
00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:36.810
Danny Park: They are not back by strategy.

367
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:44.039
Danny Park: I I i'm, I'm point to at every freaking startup right now.

368
00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:54.109
Danny Park: Right There's a reason why we have unicorns today.

369
00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:59.569
Danny Park: Right? Yeah. So Akash, you got a question or

370
00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:03.779
Akash Islam: oh, sorry, Professor, That was

371
00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:07.339
Danny Park: all right. So

372
00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:16.370
Danny Park: So let me talk about unicorns real quick. I'm gonna go in a little rain all right. There's a reason why tech stocks are taking a dump

373
00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:20.910
Danny Park: right and and and startups are like failing left and right is because

374
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:31.759
Danny Park: way back in the day there was that actually, there was an actual strategy to our, You know the big tech exist because there was an actual strategy behind the business case

375
00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:36.819
Danny Park: like there was an actual crisp, a desired outcome that was unique and new to the market.

376
00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:41.580
Danny Park: Start us. These days are nothing more than just like reinvention of the same wheel,

377
00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:44.279
Danny Park: which is a different color, bow on it.

378
00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:51.769
Danny Park: So in the market, although in the beginning people throw money on it, because there is this human concept that was losing out

379
00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:53.299
Danny Park: right

380
00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:56.760
Danny Park: just because you fear of losing out. You throw money at it.

381
00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:03.250
Danny Park: So that emotional response actually jumped valuation. Many startups.

382
00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:10.129
Danny Park: But as people start to ask these questions right, the smart people in the room, us in this room are smart people here today.

383
00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:16.020
Danny Park: People like us. We're asking the question, hey? Start up! What actually is your strategy?

384
00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:27.240
Danny Park: Oh, uh, oh, what industry are you in uh tech? No finance, no accounting, No, no marketing uh, uh, who your competitors

385
00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:29.339
Danny Park: don't know, but give me money

386
00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:32.899
Danny Park: because they don't have any of this. We talked about

387
00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:42.749
Danny Park: right? So data components very important. So let me go to the chat real quick to get a question.

388
00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:49.660
Danny Park: Ft. Hex:

389
00:44:50.650 --> 00:44:51.950
Danny Park: Yes,

390
00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:54.160
Danny Park: yes. Well

391
00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:57.629
Danny Park: sort of

392
00:44:57.890 --> 00:45:08.040
Danny Park: you know what. Here's the best way to put strategy. Ftx related to what we're talking about. They did have a strategy, but, my God! He broke away from his principles,

393
00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:26.920
Danny Park: that's I would say that's probably what you know. And that's it. Actually, that's a really good comment. I mean, from where, like you really got me like. That's a good Segue. Right? Um: yeah, It's actually worse than enron the the the the the impact, The market is um. So

394
00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:30.390
Danny Park: about Ftx: right? They both a good point

395
00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:39.960
Danny Park: as strategists. The thing that scares me, she scared me is the most right is something happening to where

396
00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:42.470
Danny Park: the principal start breaking down

397
00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:46.920
Danny Park: right? Um! But that's that's that's a good different.

398
00:45:47.070 --> 00:46:01.709
Danny Park: That's probably like the strategy, one hundred and two type stuff. But I guess the point is just because you have the principles just like anything else we have to like. Make sure that we are abiding by it. So, because there might be some business unit out there

399
00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:06.339
Danny Park: who starts building out who who who is introduced a business problem,

400
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:10.159
Danny Park: or or or create a desired outcome.

401
00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:11.509
Danny Park: And

402
00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:14.560
Danny Park: even though there's a strategy in place,

403
00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:16.540
Danny Park: they end up writing

404
00:46:16.850 --> 00:46:20.630
Danny Park: these components, but they never. They fail to check

405
00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:36.609
Danny Park: the established principles of the strategy that's backing all of this stuff, right? So they have it a lot, too, so i'm usually more like a lot of big companies. You'll see a lot of the projects and things that go awry right. You kind of you kind of like. Oh, my God, I can't believe it did that. Well, it's because, like

406
00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:40.939
Danny Park: really, there was an internal breakdown to the the rigor around,

407
00:46:41.290 --> 00:46:44.569
Danny Park: and the discipline around, making sure that as they try to

408
00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:50.850
Danny Park: the cheapest desired business outcome, they just forgot to check what the current strategy principles are.

409
00:46:51.210 --> 00:47:07.220
Danny Park: So I guess I released everyone in this class like, for example, if you're doing something in your work that you have nobody, why, you're doing it, and you feel like It's not adding any value, or you don't know It's a black box. You can just ask the question, hey? This thing i'm doing right. Um! How's that tied to our principles of our strategy?

410
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.220
If you get like bait, Blank looks

411
00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:13.950
Danny Park: email me. I'll be free to Pwc:

412
00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:16.560
Danny Park: But like

413
00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:18.779
Danny Park: it's it's important. Okay,

414
00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:23.959
Danny Park: all right. So any other questions we have, or any other comments around what we cover so far hope this is interesting,

415
00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:27.290
Danny Park: because that might be good. Yeah, Because I I find it very uh

416
00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.330
Danny Park: my, my, my

417
00:47:29.570 --> 00:47:32.100
Danny Park: my spine is tingling from the excitement.

418
00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.959
Danny Park: Um, all right. So

419
00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:37.219
Danny Park: any other questions nothing else.

420
00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:42.820
Danny Park: All right. Let's keep going. So then we talked about the components.

421
00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:53.980
Danny Park: Right? So then, that's now. Now let's talk about implementation, so we should never be acting upon or doing any implementation of anything unless we actually understand the strategy behind.

422
00:47:54.550 --> 00:47:58.030
Danny Park: So everything we talked about before. And I I think I said this multiple times.

423
00:47:58.130 --> 00:48:06.149
Danny Park: So what are the what are the general steps to implementing a data strategy? Right? Step? One, obviously is to find a business objective,

424
00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:17.570
Danny Park: right? So you look, and you look at the business objective. And after you define the business objective, you you you asking yourself, hey? Who are the stakeholders? Right stakeholder? And else we talked about right,

425
00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:25.209
Danny Park: what? What? The data management team. So the line business leaders, what a data engineer they designed it like. Why, what are your basically, your people component,

426
00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:27.779
Danny Park: And what is the desired outcome?

427
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:39.039
Danny Park: Right So then, after you find the business objectives, you define it right now you start marrying it up to the principles, right? All of your data strategy. And then you start talking about,

428
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:56.760
Danny Park: identify the data sources. Right? So where are we doing this data sources? What data do we need By who, What are we doing with it? All these different things with data? Right? We We remember this now. We could start seeing how it lines to this it relates to this. It relates to this.

429
00:48:56.870 --> 00:49:00.499
Danny Park: It relates to the seven principles, so how they all tie together

430
00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:07.730
Danny Park: right? So as you identify the data sources that you need, and all the ingredients you need to move the data from one place to another

431
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.689
Danny Park: based on your business objective that you want to meet.

432
00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:14.990
Danny Park: Right. Then you start identifying

433
00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:16.529
use cases.

434
00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:22.820
Danny Park: In other words, test subjects to start proving out that this business objective

435
00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:27.690
Danny Park: can be solved with solutions, with the data

436
00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:37.440
Danny Park: set that you have collected. Well, all the while members still still abiding by the Seven Principles of Data Quality Data acts. It did a management data content governance.

437
00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:40.459
Danny Park: This is informed decision making it analytics,

438
00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:47.190
Danny Park: right? So you test it out. So what what are we doing? What we what I call we test things out in iteration, agile mindset

439
00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:52.949
Danny Park: and increments always finding something new, asking the right questions,

440
00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:54.709
Danny Park: finding alignment,

441
00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.300
Danny Park: I always testing,

442
00:49:58.050 --> 00:50:03.120
Danny Park: checking, to see if we're. If we're we're, we're we're validating our assumptions right

443
00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:05.859
Danny Park: then. Afterwards you prove out

444
00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:08.439
Danny Park: by use cases.

445
00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:13.279
Danny Park: Then you're ready to go ahead and start getting into formulating

446
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:28.259
Danny Park: the roadmap for the actual solution. So once you get to here by the time you get to step four, all the components are filled out in this roadmap here. That's the last thing that you detailing out. So while you're implementing the steps here,

447
00:50:30.570 --> 00:50:39.279
Danny Park: you're knocking out the business case. You're knocking out the estimate. You're knocking out the goals right, which is part goals and background is part of

448
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:40.700
Danny Park: your

449
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:43.619
Danny Park: defining business objectives.

450
00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:47.520
Danny Park: Right? You'll identify the risk of success factors, right

451
00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:50.069
Danny Park: all those things you're doing,

452
00:50:50.970 --> 00:50:57.399
Danny Park: and the team maturity by to to use cases and testing the after you do all that. Then you start role mapping. Now you're sure

453
00:50:57.950 --> 00:50:59.089
Danny Park: to, hey?

454
00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:01.470
Danny Park: We've implemented these steps.

455
00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:10.609
Danny Park: We've proven out that what we want to try to solve here, and with the way we want it. We we want to approach it aligns to our seven principles,

456
00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:12.859
Danny Park: which then, in in

457
00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:17.130
Danny Park: in reality aligns to all the other frameworks that we have in our mind.

458
00:51:17.530 --> 00:51:20.499
Danny Park: So now We' to go ahead and implement an execute

459
00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:30.480
Danny Park: and create the actual technology project. I mean product or service, Right? Remember it doesn't always have to be a technology product. It also be a service.

460
00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:35.850
Danny Park: Okay. So then, that's how all these relate together.

461
00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:46.499
Danny Park: So this slide is this: this, this, this here. This flow is something that I have, you know, to something that I use day to day today,

462
00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:49.390
Danny Park: as you know, leading a data strategy here.

463
00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:55.500
Danny Park: What I do is I look at different business cases well desired outcomes

464
00:51:56.170 --> 00:51:57.680
Danny Park: right, and there's plenty.

465
00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:12.500
Danny Park: And then i'm reviewing. I'm looking at what they're doing right. Their approach. And the way they're identifying data sources the way they use case to set up, you know. Are they really? Do they really have the right use cases, or they trying to like just like to get a quick check mark

466
00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:21.360
Danny Park: and slide on this slide something underneath, because they didn't want to do the rigor behind it. I'm looking at the components. So i'm making sure that what i'm reviewing

467
00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:24.650
Danny Park: ultimately is aligning to the data strategy that we built out.

468
00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:29.849
Danny Park: Okay. And if there is, I comes a point of time where i'm seeing a bunch of business objectives

469
00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:32.500
Danny Park: where we need to do them.

470
00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:37.199
Danny Park: But it's not aligning to some data principle that we created

471
00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:41.419
Danny Park: right. So they say, under their data access. There is some

472
00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:52.120
Danny Park: some um guiding principle we have that's categorized on their data access. And let's say all the business problems we're seeing in the market. I need to loosen up

473
00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:54.390
Danny Park: that principle

474
00:52:54.430 --> 00:53:01.229
Danny Park: right? I will do so right. Paste out off the discussion. So it's like a feedback mechanism,

475
00:53:02.070 --> 00:53:02.899
Danny Park: right?

476
00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:18.070
Danny Park: And that's what data that's, what strategies do is they build it? They frame it out. They build it, they and they help others implement it, and then they always continuously improve upon it. So a lot of constants we cover so far stakeholder management agile links to Sigma

477
00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:23.210
Danny Park: big data, data, lifecycle, infrastructure. Everything we covered in this class

478
00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.429
Danny Park: is basically

479
00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:30.269
Danny Park: primes us up, all of us in this room to be data strategists,

480
00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:33.910
Danny Park: any questions on anything I covered so far.

481
00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:46.080
Danny Park: All right. So let's go to the last slide. Okay. So signs of a poor

482
00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:49.139
Danny Park: or even missing

483
00:53:49.170 --> 00:53:55.460
Danny Park: data strategy. And if you feel and these are just, this is not an exhaustive list.

484
00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:59.679
Danny Park: These are the ones that came to my mind that they are top of my mind.

485
00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:01.620
Danny Park: There's several others.

486
00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:03.700
Danny Park: But

487
00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:05.419
Danny Park: excuse me

488
00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:09.910
Danny Park: for those in this room.

489
00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:25.150
Danny Park: If you are checking more than one of these bullet boxes where you work. All that screams to you is, I have opportunity to make a name for myself. Let me see if I could frame out

490
00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:33.109
Danny Park: a proof of concept data strategy based on what we covered today in class. And let me see if I could present this to someone,

491
00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:38.500
Danny Park: because in the worst case scenario it highlights how you think like a strategist

492
00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:41.169
Danny Park: as the worst thing that could happen,

493
00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:46.049
Danny Park: and the best thing that could happen is you get selected to pursue

494
00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:49.509
Danny Park: creating out a data strategy for your group

495
00:54:50.330 --> 00:55:06.519
Danny Park: which would lead to promotions, phrases, bonuses, and resume points to where one day, since you are living data strategy, you could go ahead and interview for a straggl at Google, Facebook, Meta, Jpm. Google, et cetera, et cetera.

496
00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:10.630
Danny Park: Okay. So here the post here are the signs of port data strategy

497
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:15.570
Danny Park: because I i'm gonna tackle them. And i'm going to use the system information system component

498
00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:17.850
Danny Park: component um

499
00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:22.450
Danny Park: uh framework and laid out that way. So the people side.

500
00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:24.300
Danny Park: Okay, if you lack.

501
00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:30.739
Danny Park: So if there is a lack of clear roles and responsibilities leading to redundant work or work not assigned. So, for example,

502
00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:35.840
Danny Park: if you're working on something and you have no idea what you're doing, I don't know what your role or responsibilities Are

503
00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:51.240
Danny Park: you just just doing work just to do work you just told to do it. We do really understand, like, Hey, what are my limits? What's my authority here? What's my role. So role and responsibility is actually giving you a level of your authority with network that you're doing.

504
00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:53.580
Danny Park: Can you delegate it? Can you not?

505
00:55:54.520 --> 00:56:00.050
Danny Park: You do with it at all. Are you allowed to do it? I mean I should you do it. Are you supposed to? You should be doing it?

506
00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:04.280
Danny Park: Maybe your magic gave you the wrong work to do,

507
00:56:05.090 --> 00:56:07.050
Danny Park: and, in fact, you shouldn't be really doing it

508
00:56:07.410 --> 00:56:12.069
Danny Park: and violate some law who knows right. So if you don't know your rules and responsibilities.

509
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:14.199
Danny Park: Red Flag Number One.

510
00:56:14.650 --> 00:56:16.349
Danny Park: Oh, one of the red flags.

511
00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:21.670
Danny Park: Okay, there are redundant skill sets across roles and functions. So what does what does that mean?

512
00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:25.399
Danny Park: So that will mean, Let's say,

513
00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:38.060
Danny Park: I say, that we're in a I I was like I got to stop picking on taxes. I promise myself next semester. I'm going to use marketing

514
00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:46.030
Danny Park: as the the guinea pig in my analogy. So this is this young I stick to tax. I mean this semester. So taxes. Let's talk about in tax,

515
00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:54.309
Danny Park: Let's say, in tax. You have a team working on a tax advisement right? And that tax advisement

516
00:56:55.790 --> 00:56:56.919
Danny Park: group

517
00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:58.120
Danny Park: is

518
00:56:58.510 --> 00:57:00.229
Danny Park: asking for

519
00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:03.540
Danny Park: accuracy of taxable income

520
00:57:03.570 --> 00:57:05.310
Danny Park: for that jurisdiction,

521
00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:10.270
Danny Park: and it's tax liability for

522
00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:15.240
Danny Park: Australia and Canada. Right? It's just asking for those two things.

523
00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:18.109
Danny Park: Okay, So

524
00:57:20.110 --> 00:57:21.820
Danny Park: let's say I build a team.

525
00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:24.270
Danny Park: And this team I have

526
00:57:26.070 --> 00:57:27.240
Danny Park: three people

527
00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:31.119
Danny Park: and all three people

528
00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:32.950
Danny Park: our Cpas,

529
00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:35.370
Danny Park: and they know how to do taxable income,

530
00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:38.779
Danny Park: right?

531
00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:42.319
Danny Park: But they have never worked on

532
00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:44.349
Danny Park: a Canadian

533
00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:46.990
Danny Park: tax return.

534
00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:50.569
Danny Park: But two of them have done Germany

535
00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:52.100
Danny Park: right?

536
00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:54.760
Danny Park: So what's wrong there?

537
00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.419
Danny Park: Right from a lead perspective.

538
00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:05.569
I don't have the right talent. Mix

539
00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:08.889
Danny Park: because I don't need three people. Cpas

540
00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:14.280
Danny Park: and people. Cpas are expensive, so I over staff with Cpas unnecessarily.

541
00:58:14.310 --> 00:58:15.709
Danny Park: And in fact,

542
00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:25.849
Danny Park: us American taxable income.

543
00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:28.679
Danny Park: They don't know Canadian

544
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:41.780
Danny Park: tax returns. So I missed that my team, so I've redundant skill sets across my roles and functions, and in fact, i'm because of my redundancy. I'm missing a course. Skill says no one knows how to do it. Goddamn Canadian return.

545
00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:47.240
Danny Park: So i'm probably going to do very poor job of meeting this the client service expectation.

546
00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:57.079
Danny Park: So where does that? Why does that go back? Because in my data strategy, if I was, if I, withholding, holding to the seven principles

547
00:59:08.930 --> 00:59:11.239
Danny Park: and governance would tell me.

548
00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:14.469
Danny Park: I'll be able to back in to say that, hey?

549
00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:23.009
Danny Park: I have to make sure that my people component is staff with the right skill sets.

550
00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:32.110
Danny Park: So I have to be able to forecast to some degree that I have enough people the right skill system moving around. So that's that's how that relates

551
00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:37.739
Danny Park: to possibly not aligning or not having a missing um

552
00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:39.629
Danny Park: data strategy component.

553
00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:40.930
Danny Park: Okay.

554
00:59:41.350 --> 00:59:44.700
Danny Park: Alright, So another. Oh, see a chat.

555
00:59:45.310 --> 00:59:47.270
Danny Park: Get up Nine utilization. Yup! Yup!

556
00:59:48.290 --> 00:59:50.450
Danny Park: Absolutely. So next one

557
00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:59.790
Danny Park: next red flag for a ported a strategy. If your efforts that you that you that the things that you're doing, or the thing that your group is doing it like kind of leads to nowhere

558
01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:02.509
Danny Park: like you do all this work.

559
01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:11.380
Danny Park: But at the end of the end. They say you have your annual review, and no one tells you that how your efforts tied to to the, to the, to the to the strategy of the business.

560
01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:14.680
Danny Park: Right? It's like, Hey,

561
01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:23.440
Danny Park: hey? Daniel and T. And Daniel, You've been part of a team that was tasked to do or execute this,

562
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:25.790
Danny Park: this business

563
01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:32.470
Danny Park: project or operation to the this, to to meet this desired outcome,

564
01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:36.109
Danny Park: and this business design outcome was X

565
01:00:36.970 --> 01:00:40.740
Danny Park: and This X was contributing to

566
01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:50.659
Danny Park: twenty-five of the company's revenue. So your team was directly influential uh to to succeed or achieve our business strategy.

567
01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:54.929
Danny Park: Awesome annual review,

568
01:00:55.710 --> 01:00:57.690
Danny Park: great motivating factor

569
01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:00.630
Danny Park: versus Hey, Daniel,

570
01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:03.260
Danny Park: you did a good job.

571
01:01:03.350 --> 01:01:10.800
Danny Park: You are here against your peers and your raise is this thanks? Have a good day. See you next year.

572
01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:15.359
Danny Park: Right? That second part

573
01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:17.770
Danny Park: and your review feedback

574
01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:20.110
Danny Park: that gives you a lot of red flags,

575
01:01:23.610 --> 01:01:26.680
Danny Park: right? Which then will lead to a lot of other waste

576
01:01:26.890 --> 01:01:33.740
Danny Park: right, which is high turnover, which is not utilized talent or idle. It'll work right. So

577
01:01:34.550 --> 01:01:41.190
Danny Park: keep that in mind. A good data strategy or a good strategy. Has the people component in mind

578
01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:45.950
Danny Park: that ensures inspiration and management together.

579
01:01:47.310 --> 01:01:58.329
Danny Park: I remember what I said when I was up when i'm up here I broke the three pillars, and I put people process tech data across, and I was writing out literally who I needed in the processes around it,

580
01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:04.220
Danny Park: because I knew that if I can't retain my talent,

581
01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:08.570
Danny Park: and I have no one to do my machine learning my strategy fails.

582
01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:18.429
Danny Park: Remember all this stuff ties back. That's what makes it. Good business leader versus not a good physically to understand how all this works holistically.

583
01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:24.200
Danny Park: It connects with us. It has a really good strategy a comprehensive value-driven strategy,

584
01:02:26.770 --> 01:02:39.139
Danny Park: all right, and the last one is lack of understanding of this outcome. And we talked about this. If you have no idea what your if you don't know your your mission statement of your department and your organization, or what the strategies for your company, th the severe things going on

585
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.080
Danny Park: for sure.

586
01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:45.540
Danny Park: All right. So let's go to the data component.

587
01:02:46.550 --> 01:02:54.829
Danny Park: And this is where you probably find the biggest, like like red flags around, there being a poor data strategy, so like some of the other components, it's kind of like

588
01:02:56.150 --> 01:03:06.479
Danny Park: like under the rug there might be. But if you see this like it's for sure, like. There's no one in your organization the organization thinking about the data strategy at all. So, for example, there's no golden source of truth.

589
01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:12.500
Danny Park: It kind of relates to the group project. Oh, as a name, go ahead.

590
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:32.689
Zainab Adekola: It's Zena. Sorry. Sorry. No, No problem. Um. I was just gonna like agree with that statement, because where I work as well, well like the field that I've been working in for while I've seen that they don't really invest in technology and like the public and people really

591
01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:49.370
Zainab Adekola: software, because key functions and key things that technology can do and can help they just. I I don't know what it is, but for some reason they don't see it, and they guess they just don't want to improve on it, either, and people are really being affected by it.

592
01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:55.570
Danny Park: No, thank you for that feedback, but I think we know that. I think we know why now, because

593
01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:59.179
Danny Park: there's no one thinking about the real things,

594
01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:02.430
Danny Park: and then they don't care.

595
01:04:02.670 --> 01:04:11.980
Danny Park: You know what. That's a great, you know. Great! That's a great comment that you said, because I I get this a lot um, and it's it could be true. But

596
01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:17.329
Danny Park: what I've learned over time is that sometimes people don't care because they don't understand

597
01:04:18.410 --> 01:04:22.209
Danny Park: right, because when people understand something, they tend to

598
01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:26.160
Danny Park: feel more and be less dismissive.

599
01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:35.259
Danny Park: Right, because because not caring, being dismissive sometimes as a defense against our embarrassment, that we don't know something that we should.

600
01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:36.290
Danny Park: So

601
01:04:36.550 --> 01:04:38.980
Danny Park: what I sometimes translate it is

602
01:04:39.210 --> 01:04:40.060
Danny Park: that

603
01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:42.790
Danny Park: where I sometimes, if I talk to executives,

604
01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:46.050
Danny Park: they clearly dismissed.

605
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:49.529
Danny Park: But they're not evil or mean people.

606
01:04:49.550 --> 01:04:56.189
Danny Park: But what I recognize sometimes is that oh, there's being dismissive because they don't want to feel like they're

607
01:04:56.360 --> 01:05:05.539
Danny Park: not being in their minds. They don't want to show that they're incompetent in something because they have to uphold a certain level of personal brand.

608
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:15.649
Danny Park: Yeah, Yeah. So so. But that to us as Mbas, that's where we make our opportunity.

609
01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:35.889
Danny Park: So when we feel an executive, so go back to our stakeholder analysis. If we know someone is highly influential, and if we recognize it to being dismissive of a topic. You know what i'm doing. I'm building something out on a Powerpoint deck on my own time, and when I go grab lunch with that person just to have a network. I'm like, hey? You know, Last time we had a talk

610
01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:42.689
Danny Park: I feel like you had some. You know you need some help with this. But here's something I did over the weekend to wait. Is it? Okay? If I show you,

611
01:05:43.170 --> 01:05:44.629
Danny Park: I done this,

612
01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:54.799
Danny Park: and immediately boom good Graces radar. I'm the best. I'm. Danny needs to be on the project. Get him on the next project and boom, boom, boom!

613
01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:56.930
Danny Park: So

614
01:05:57.010 --> 01:06:07.369
Danny Park: as good business leaders. That's a part of what they recognize. So leadership is not a rank based thing, and leadership is a is it? It goes across all ranks.

615
01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:12.830
Danny Park: Right? So I kind of give a story about the military, like the marine cor, we don't have this concept of rank based leadership.

616
01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:25.990
Danny Park: We have. What we say is in the absence of leadership. Take charge. That's our motto when it comes to building our leaders in the Marine Corps. So what that says is what we're telling. Marines is, hey? Just because you have a general

617
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:34.119
Danny Park: that general strides away from leadership or responsibility. There's no reason why you can't take up that mantle and assume that leadership role,

618
01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:38.809
Danny Park: because a rank is nothing and rank is an imaginary thing. We made that up. We

619
01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:48.190
Danny Park: right just based on how long we work. But how how silly does that sound like you? You get a default, Your leadership really? Just because you haven't been around long enough.

620
01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:59.520
Danny Park: That's a very, that's a that. In fact, that's very silly way to look at it. So I I would challenge everyone in this class because everyone has the ability to do it to where, when you're recognizing these dismissive things,

621
01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:08.420
Danny Park: use the things that we learned in class, and you learned in other classes to bring that tied back together and just show what you did,

622
01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:09.509
Danny Park: and

623
01:07:09.810 --> 01:07:17.009
Danny Park: sometimes they might not go anywhere. But sometimes it goes to the great places absolutely. But thank you for sharing that as an app.

624
01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.939
Danny Park: Um, All right. So

625
01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:23.150
Danny Park: let's keep going here. I know we're almost on time.

626
01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:26.810
Danny Park: Okay. So data no golden source of truth,

627
01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:28.279
Danny Park: meaning

628
01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:42.109
Danny Park: right. It happens all the time Right? I I just laugh because, like it happens all the time.

629
01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:44.569
Danny Park: Um!

630
01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:51.199
Danny Park: And usually it's a a good way to know, like your your data system doesn't really, or you technologies that have like a

631
01:07:53.010 --> 01:07:54.399
Danny Park: No, i'm gonna take it back.

632
01:07:54.790 --> 01:07:58.569
Danny Park: I'm not gonna say this to me. I was gonna say it was too aggressive. What I would say is

633
01:07:58.910 --> 01:08:06.580
Danny Park: a lot of thoughtful technologies that abide by a data strategy when you do work, what does it give you? It gives you an order trail of the data,

634
01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:10.199
Danny Park: right time, Who? When? Where?

635
01:08:10.290 --> 01:08:28.110
Danny Park: So when you see a a technology platform that gives you an audit trail of every time a data was processed or sent from one place to another. That's because that data platform, when they were building out the roadmap for that data platform. One of the requirements they were building in was abiding by their data strategy, principles

636
01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:30.809
Danny Park: of data, quality data, access data management.

637
01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:37.609
Danny Park: See? It's a point. I hope I'm highlighting this. How important the principals they just your Ag are

638
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:45.200
Danny Park: okay. Um. Next one over processing or rework due to data and accuracy. So basically you you pull data, and the thing is wrong.

639
01:08:45.370 --> 01:08:49.889
Danny Park: The data is wrong, outdated right? So clearly there's no data strategy behind that

640
01:08:50.580 --> 01:09:10.050
Danny Park: uh unmanageable infrastructure. I'd be talked about before right if you have several different multiple applications, and they're all creating data because lifecycle says they do It's real. They have to store it because it's also real, And that means that there's a bunch of waste going on there too much data you collecting? Right? So then, then, your infrastructure becomes unmanageable.

641
01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:13.580
Danny Park: Okay,

642
01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:17.290
Danny Park: sort of uh relates to our group project

643
01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:20.529
Danny Park: this joint, the data service delivery,

644
01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:29.890
Danny Park: right? What does that mean? That means that there are multiple applications, But they don't talk to one another. They're not integrated. So the data services are siloed.

645
01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:33.999
Danny Park: So what does that mean a lot of manual work to review

646
01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:37.269
Danny Park: and check for accuracy of data?

647
01:09:38.430 --> 01:09:46.329
Danny Park: Right? Because the fact that you have no data service and disjointed it defeats the principle of data management data, access to data quality,

648
01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:57.369
Danny Park: right? And they come with some audits or the disappointing. Or so. We talked about this like basically you. Key is an audit trail. This is a traceability, you know where the data came from,

649
01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:08.230
Danny Park: all right next lever. So now we talked about data. So if you see in your data that you're working with, you see one of one or many of these, you probably don't have either strategy

650
01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:09.939
or no one is talking about it.

651
01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:12.889
Danny Park: Technology lever.

652
01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:23.190
Danny Park: There are platforms in your your. You're in a technology working on it, but it doesn't do some critical need that you have. So you have to do that work outside of the system.

653
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:30.489
Danny Park: So you have to do it manually, and you have to do whatever you did manually. Let's see on excel. You have to upload that back into your platform.

654
01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:46.009
Danny Park: Okay, So that's one key indicator that you don't have a data strategy, because because if it's data access and data management, because if you're using platform to do something, they get pulling down data to work on it manually, then pull it back up. You got some real issues.

655
01:10:46.490 --> 01:10:48.969
Danny Park: Well, actually all three, three, four, and five,

656
01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:54.280
Danny Park: all right.

657
01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:58.019
Danny Park: Platforms have redundant functions and keep with

658
01:10:58.070 --> 01:11:04.660
Danny Park: platforms with redundant functions and capabilities. So i'll give an example. So this is notorious and tax tax technology.

659
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:09.710
Danny Park: So some firms have multiple tax technology platforms

660
01:11:09.770 --> 01:11:11.749
Danny Park: and these platforms

661
01:11:12.210 --> 01:11:18.260
Danny Park: essentially they really do the same thing. But each platform just happens to do one thing really well.

662
01:11:18.930 --> 01:11:29.509
Danny Park: So what most companies do is they'll just like they somehow use one platform to that one thing that does it really Well, they pull that data out, and they put into the next system and do the next function really really well.

663
01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:31.530
Danny Park: So

664
01:11:32.190 --> 01:11:42.059
Danny Park: because you're providing this cafeteria style of capabilities across several different platforms, you're not creating a standard approach to how to get the work done.

665
01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:45.270
Danny Park: Okay, Emily, go ahead. I see you and off mute. Yeah.

666
01:11:46.490 --> 01:11:47.629
Danny Park: Oh, never mind.

667
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:59.179
Emily U: It's an accident. I do have a question. Um. I was wondering. I know we touched on it a little bit before, I think, with Ftx and uh

668
01:11:59.430 --> 01:12:17.119
Danny Park: um, and maybe data governance. But um! Where is like ethics? I guess, like, Where is that ethics Yup business at this sits in governance. So so company most firms have a actual Ethics committee

669
01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:26.180
Danny Park: that touches upon. So Their Their scope is broad, but it's it's It's a very it's a very uh important.

670
01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:29.219
Danny Park: It's a very important function, because

671
01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:32.279
Danny Park: Essex actually drives the culture

672
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:43.649
Danny Park: of the organization and the cultures give birth to strategies. Yeah, So it's like we didn't cover it here. But business ethics is very important, very important. Um

673
01:12:43.850 --> 01:12:44.860
Danny Park: topic.

674
01:12:44.930 --> 01:12:52.559
Danny Park: A lot of like a lot of Phds and people with like religious backgrounds actually advise on ethics for many boards.

675
01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:56.370
Danny Park: Yeah. So yeah, it's It's It's pretty cool. Um!

676
01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:59.229
Danny Park: I don't know if he still works there. I was like

677
01:12:59.590 --> 01:13:01.649
Danny Park: he was in his seventies when I was going

678
01:13:01.890 --> 01:13:10.629
Danny Park: to Peru, so he's probably retired by now, But I had a really great is Is Donald Shepherd still around anyone know that name? Donald Shepherds?

679
01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:13.599
Danny Park: Now?

680
01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:22.090
Danny Park: Okay, Probably not. Okay. Silence is no Okay, but Donald Shepherd is Professor Professor Shepherd. I took business ethics with him. He blew my mind.

681
01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:32.289
Danny Park: He blew my mind out of the order. He was such a great inspiration, and just to talk about ethics all the time, and really helped me rationalize what he meant to be a leader.

682
01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:40.810
Danny Park: Um, but it was. Yeah, but business ethics are very. It's a very good course for anyone to take, but i'll take it back that way. Let me take a real fact, it depends on who's teaching it.

683
01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:44.080
Danny Park: So twenty one one take business ethics.

684
01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:53.029
Danny Park: I don't know if it's elective or core, but regardless it's those are all the topics where it really takes someone with experience, a lot of research

685
01:13:53.130 --> 01:13:54.890
Danny Park: to be able to teach that. Well.

686
01:13:56.660 --> 01:13:59.880
Danny Park: Oh, it's required, or I hope it's taught by the right person.

687
01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:02.949
Danny Park: It's like,

688
01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:06.180
Danny Park: Imagine Dennis Rodman teaching and ethics.

689
01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:17.919
Danny Park: All right. So okay, that's

690
01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:30.740
Danny Park: Oh, where we were. Okay. So then, okay, So we're at next. Okay, we have platforms, redundant function capabilities that the next is functions and capabilities spread across multiple technologies. Right? So basically,

691
01:14:31.950 --> 01:14:35.370
Danny Park: yeah, the same system multiple times.

692
01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:37.290
Danny Park: And

693
01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:38.880
Danny Park: you don't know why.

694
01:14:38.970 --> 01:14:52.690
Danny Park: But uh, actually, we do know why, is because when they were the procurement side of the house had no idea what the data strategy was. So they kept buying capabilities and functions that already existed in the company

695
01:14:58.790 --> 01:15:04.599
Danny Park: That buying un. Oh, sorry about that buying unnecessary

696
01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:12.779
Danny Park: technologies actually fall on the governance. Your governance should have a process that controls how or when things are procured.

697
01:15:12.850 --> 01:15:14.749
Danny Park: So I know we didn't cover that

698
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:16.010
Danny Park: um,

699
01:15:16.110 --> 01:15:19.510
Danny Park: but that's where it fall, fall on the governance, right? So

700
01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:34.150
Danny Park: that's one. If you see multiple like functions, capabilities for the costs, multiple technologies. That's a big problem. The last one technology is lack of data integrations cost platform. So we kind of covered it in the disjointed data service, which kind of relates to lack of data integrations across platforms.

701
01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:36.640
Danny Park: Okay, So basically the group project.

702
01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:43.120
Danny Park: All right, Let me check the chat real quick. Oh, that's wrong. Yeah. All right. Process,

703
01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:44.320
Danny Park: All right.

704
01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:51.160
Danny Park: Number one in process, if you're working on something,

705
01:15:51.650 --> 01:15:52.670
Danny Park: and

706
01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:55.479
Danny Park: that deliverable that you're working on

707
01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:57.219
Danny Park: is being reviewed

708
01:15:58.190 --> 01:15:59.210
Danny Park: like

709
01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:02.279
Danny Park: literally like four or five times

710
01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:03.769
Danny Park: by different people,

711
01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:05.990
Danny Park: there's something going wrong there.

712
01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:10.250
Danny Park: And again, for anyone who's in a tax practice, or who's or is a tax account?

713
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:14.689
Danny Park: Well, in turn for tax. You know exactly what i'm talking about,

714
01:16:14.930 --> 01:16:23.430
Danny Park: right? And though the people aren't crazy no taxes that difficult, it's because there's no strategy around delivering tax work

715
01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:31.569
Danny Park: all right. Multiple decision points the logical phase gate. So what that means is

716
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.960
Danny Park: decision should happen when

717
01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:44.330
Danny Park: things are ready to me like you have to be ready to make a decision, so I guess the best example I would give is like

718
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:48.729
Danny Park: I'll give like a college one.

719
01:16:50.850 --> 01:16:53.410
Danny Park: Let's say you and your group of friends want to go out

720
01:16:55.310 --> 01:17:01.370
Danny Park: right, and you want to go to like the most exclusive club in New York, right? But you haven't, really.

721
01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:06.589
Danny Park: But like, when will you decide to go to that. Try to get this exclusive clump

722
01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:10.059
Danny Park: like six Pm. In the middle of class

723
01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:20.739
Danny Park: or not. Six Pm. This is college I don't know, may right like tall payment, a little class or nine Pm. When you look at all your friends and you go yuck,

724
01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:31.759
Danny Park: they will never get it right. So when you make so you make a decision at the end Right? You see all the data, all the variables and the data collection, you know, like you collect all the facts

725
01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:33.380
Danny Park: that's relevant

726
01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:51.020
Danny Park: and accurate. Then you make a decision. You don't make a decision before, because if you made a decision at twelve Pm. And you go, Hey, yo! Let's show up at. I don't know Exclusive Club, Abc. And your friends show up, and half of them are in like a tennis gear. And you like what the hell

727
01:17:51.170 --> 01:18:08.480
Danny Park: when negative, so like bad decision, right? So like that's like That's like a fun analogy. Hopefully, it makes sense. But also the point is in that process. Your decision point that you make what that decision point. Activity needs to happen when everyone's ready to not only make the decision, but agree to it.

728
01:18:09.710 --> 01:18:15.939
Danny Park: Right. How many times have we been on a meeting with? Someone makes a decision, and someone's like completely like

729
01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:18.370
Danny Park: the like, saying, No, we don't want to do it,

730
01:18:19.290 --> 01:18:20.360
Danny Park: because

731
01:18:21.070 --> 01:18:25.000
Danny Park: the person making the decision didn't have all the facts

732
01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:30.130
Danny Park: right, or let's say there's someone who wasn't on the meeting, and the decision was made.

733
01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:36.959
Danny Park: But that person who was not who left off the meeting was a key driver to implementing that decision.

734
01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:44.240
Danny Park: So why would you make that decision in that meeting if you knew that person that you needed wasn't there,

735
01:18:44.570 --> 01:18:48.120
Danny Park: so that's not. That's not a logical place to put that decision point

736
01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:58.950
Danny Park: right. That's another. That's another example of why you There's no strategy. Because, like, here's another. I guess all of you should have experienced this by now.

737
01:18:59.070 --> 01:19:02.099
Danny Park: I'm sure you've been on meetings with someone just made a decision

738
01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:07.959
Danny Park: right with that rule, discussion, or anything else like a decision was made right.

739
01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:13.589
Danny Park: That's because there was a strategy behind. This is a strategy. A strategy tells you

740
01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:16.410
Danny Park: what governs when decisions should be made,

741
01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:18.050
Danny Park: and when that should be made.

742
01:19:19.450 --> 01:19:21.409
Danny Park: So It kind of relates to our project, too,

743
01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:26.000
Danny Park: all right, upstream and downstream process that this jointed. So. In other words,

744
01:19:29.550 --> 01:19:39.120
Danny Park: like they're people working at different processes, they clearly related. But like a example of this joint, there would be one group finish that work ahead it like early,

745
01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:45.689
Danny Park: but then the other group is not ready for some reason. So there's a disjointed process upstream and dancing process.

746
01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:51.680
Danny Park: There's some something going on that's not integrating and streamlining those two upstream downstream,

747
01:19:51.730 --> 01:19:59.359
Danny Park: right? So there's some waste in between happening. It could be idle transportation over processing, or it could be several things

748
01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:07.609
Danny Park: right. But there's some waste in between the upstream and downstream. So that's another example of There might be poor uh strategy happening

749
01:20:09.010 --> 01:20:15.619
Danny Park: multiple exceptions to the general process. In other words. Reason why there's multiple exceptions to a general rule is because no one understands what's going on.

750
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:22.490
Danny Park: All right. We kind of talked about this in our um process analytics

751
01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:30.090
Danny Park: right? Especially if you don't have. If it is a business. I'm going on. I don't have a root cause

752
01:20:30.770 --> 01:20:35.919
Danny Park: so like what people are building is. They're building processes on top of processes to solution it

753
01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:51.340
Danny Park: Right? He's like. If you see this, do that, and if you see that you do that if you see that you do that so like there, there's a process, but it is ten symptoms, and you're like, hey? For each symptom. If you see it. You do this other thing instead of saying, Hey, What's the real cause of all these symptoms?

754
01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:59.169
Danny Park: Because if you find the root cause of all these sentences you eliminated. Then you don't have ten exceptions. You have one process

755
01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:03.099
Danny Park: that's efficient, with no exceptions.

756
01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:05.880
Danny Park: So a strategy

757
01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:07.080
Danny Park: right

758
01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:10.500
Danny Park: under

759
01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:11.920
Danny Park: governance

760
01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:13.849
Danny Park: and quality

761
01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:22.719
Danny Park: will help you drive to the root cause to help you not have so many exceptions to a general rule.

762
01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:31.859
Danny Park: Okay. And the last one process that has no business justification. So basically if you're working on something and you have like that, it shouldn't be there anymore

763
01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:35.580
Danny Park: because it's based on an old rule.

764
01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:39.769
Danny Park: Yeah, I go back to tax at the tax example.

765
01:21:40.510 --> 01:21:42.710
Danny Park: About way back in the day

766
01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:47.560
Danny Park: you had to actually physically print out your tax returns and file them in a file cabinet

767
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:49.769
Danny Park: right?

768
01:21:50.210 --> 01:21:52.320
But that was an actual rule,

769
01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:55.839
Danny Park: but in two thousand and twenty-two,

770
01:21:55.940 --> 01:21:58.860
Danny Park: since we have something called Xblr,

771
01:21:59.710 --> 01:22:00.630
Danny Park: right,

772
01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:10.719
Danny Park: an xml file formats, which the which the Irs readily accept. There is no need to print a physical return anymore.

773
01:22:11.550 --> 01:22:14.209
Danny Park: There's no rule. It's optional. Now,

774
01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:20.859
Danny Park: as long as you have the the physical copy or the the digital copies of the Xml that was filed.

775
01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:33.240
Danny Park: And the Irs is, you know, um message back to you in the Xml format that it has received, and accept that your your return. You are safe Legally, it proven You filed your tax return

776
01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:34.730
Danny Park: right.

777
01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:53.960
Danny Park: So now, these days of some team. There's some teams that I know of that still print out their returns, and I asked them, Why do you print this? Out They go. Oh, well, because it's proof. Oh, I go. Okay, How do you? How do you know that? That thing you print out is accurate that no one mess with it. They go. Well, how do they mess with it? Okay. So I take the Pdf. And I manually right over.

778
01:22:54.700 --> 01:23:02.350
Danny Park: I edit the Pdf. And I text it, and then I I really save it over. So it looks like that. You can't. You can't see it So a mess with it.

779
01:23:04.150 --> 01:23:06.840
Danny Park: Did I ask him. Okay, I just mess with that Pdf:

780
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.600
Danny Park: So I did some fraud.

781
01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:18.940
Danny Park: Hold up the Xml. You got that you file to the Irs. Can I mess with that they go. No. So which one do you think the I is going to ask for when you go into? And when you go into a a disagreement.

782
01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:23.309
Danny Park: The Pdf. That you do it, or you can, Doctor, or the xml they sent you.

783
01:23:23.330 --> 01:23:26.230
Danny Park: Oh, Xml: good. So why are you printing the Pdf for

784
01:23:28.330 --> 01:23:30.029
Danny Park: right data strategy,

785
01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:34.029
Danny Park: right? When we go back to that, we go back to our seven right

786
01:23:34.250 --> 01:23:36.630
Danny Park: content and management.

787
01:23:37.930 --> 01:23:43.599
Danny Park: Why am I printing? I don't need it. That's the content I don't need, and I know how to store it,

788
01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:45.989
Danny Park: which is safer and more reliable.

789
01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:48.409
Danny Park: So why am I printing a Pdf.

790
01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:52.489
Danny Park: Right goes back to my strategy again. It goes back to strategy right

791
01:23:52.730 --> 01:23:54.589
Danny Park: Next last one is measure

792
01:23:54.650 --> 01:23:56.600
Danny Park: seven. Fifteen is the last one.

793
01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:09.379
Danny Park: Basically it's common sense stuff, like, if you, if you don't know what you're measuring, you don't have okrs and kpis that tell you if you on track or not, you don't have A. You don't have a strategy. There's no way there's no way.

794
01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:11.870
Danny Park: Next one

795
01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:20.160
Danny Park: measures that cannot be traced to source. Right. Let's say you have a bunch of like results. But you don't know how those results are being calculated,

796
01:24:20.270 --> 01:24:27.719
Danny Park: or or where the data came from to calculate those measures Right? That's another port side of data strategy because you can't trust the Kps at that point.

797
01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:29.980
Danny Park: So it's like You're not measuring at all

798
01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:31.780
Danny Park: right.

799
01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:47.810
Danny Park: Lack of kpis. Also, the first one was. It's not lining to business strategy. And basically the lack of kpis. And last one was last. One is rough order of magnitude. So what is rough order of magnitude, the acronym being Rom. So Rom,

800
01:24:47.820 --> 01:25:13.640
Danny Park: our high level estimates that you give when you have no idea what the business problem is, or how to solve it. So it's like my! It's like me calling a plumber and saying, Hey, I have a word leak in my bath, and how much is going to cost me, and diploma is going to be like I don't know five dollars to to ten thousand dollars. I have no idea I got. I need more details, so that range estimate is called the rough order of magnitude. So if your estimates that you have for your

801
01:25:13.650 --> 01:25:15.099
Danny Park: business case

802
01:25:15.730 --> 01:25:20.929
Danny Park: right, and your estimate. Your budget estimates are on the rough order of magnitude.

803
01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:26.530
Danny Park: You Don't, have you? You're not abiding by the principles of sound data strategy at all.

804
01:25:27.650 --> 01:25:37.459
Danny Park: All right. So that's the signs of poor data strategy. Just again a limited, a limited set, not exhaustive, but some red flags. So i'll stop here

805
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:40.290
Danny Park: any questions on anything I went over today.

806
01:25:41.780 --> 01:25:59.190
Bo Young Choi: Um, it's more of a comment, so I so you know, for, like it could be a little bit our topic. But it's information system like Could that also be a type of data strategy? Because I see, like the components you listed here.

807
01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:18.749
Bo Young Choi: My other class, when we're learning about like. Is it also list how like the components of what makes a good information system is when structure technology has some people are in are like codependent. So everything kind of needs to like flow, and I just still had this slide also has the same points

808
01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:25.670
Danny Park: as a makes up on the information system. No: sorry. So these. So these are the components of the information system.

809
01:26:25.710 --> 01:26:28.070
Danny Park: The information system

810
01:26:28.490 --> 01:26:29.620
Danny Park: is

811
01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:37.359
Danny Park: that framework is is trying to align these components to one another, right?

812
01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:40.660
Danny Park: The data strategy

813
01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:50.049
Danny Park: is a set of principles that ensures that when you're building out your information system that there is alignment between them.

814
01:26:50.140 --> 01:27:07.199
Danny Park: Okay, So when there is misalignment, some of the information, some components. That's a sign that the data strategy is non-existent, because the theory goes that if you have a sound data strategy that is structuring all these into one integrated value-driven

815
01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:15.189
Danny Park: um structure. Then all of your information system components should be aligning with one another. So

816
01:27:15.490 --> 01:27:23.209
Danny Park: your question might be, hey? Even if I don't have a data strategy, if I abide by these

817
01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:32.000
Danny Park: for components and align them. Is that the same thing as strategy? The answer is, No, because you can build

818
01:27:32.250 --> 01:27:37.099
Danny Park: information system strategy. That's not tied to the business strategy,

819
01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:43.249
Danny Park: right? Because it doesn't mean that just because you're aligning the the the the components together,

820
01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:49.599
Danny Park: the business purpose of your information system, the business case, and the goals

821
01:27:49.770 --> 01:27:57.790
Danny Park: might not tie back to What? You what the company really desires. Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, you're welcome,

822
01:27:58.170 --> 01:27:59.660
Danny Park: Crystal. Go ahead. Yeah.

823
01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:28.340
crystal.warner: Uh: So I had a question from uh the last slide, which was ten in reference to the process. Um, in which you stated Um, you know you would try to avoid, or rather a port data. Strategy has multiple review points. So in order to kind of enhance that or condense it or make it more efficient, Um, would you say that Um, instead of having the multiple review sessions, you can either eliminate some or is it up to like,

824
01:28:28.350 --> 01:28:46.309
crystal.warner: not lower level? But i'm gonna say, like a lower level staff manager to kind of go through and um weed out most of the relevant data, for then the um, like higher ups, to approve or look at that information instead, which would eliminate some of the review

825
01:28:46.370 --> 01:28:50.949
Danny Park: points or process. Yes, the latter. Yeah, there is. So

826
01:28:51.640 --> 01:29:03.070
Danny Park: to your point. What usually happens is multiple viewpoints are usually established, because there's two things going on. Either they don't they, they don't trust the data

827
01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:16.730
Danny Park: or and not trusting data means that it could be several things you don't know where it comes from. They don't know who's giving it to them, and things like that. The second mistrust is, and the people,

828
01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:27.470
Danny Park: meaning that they don't, you know they might be. They might feel like they're two junior, or maybe that's like qualified, or they might actually question their competency and doing actual data processing right? So

829
01:29:27.740 --> 01:29:45.379
Danny Park: the multiple viewpoints to tackle it to your point would be, you know, definitely going more upstream in the process that downstream with the reviewers are but going more upstream and building around like some framework there to ensure that the data is more of higher quality. You have Tracey building the data. And

830
01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:49.949
Danny Park: a really great thing that that that drives down review points lower is

831
01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:57.560
Danny Park: and use a simple example. Let's say someone a a junior level person is working on a a, a processing, a calculation file.

832
01:29:57.700 --> 01:30:01.620
Danny Park: All they really need to do is provide an aud of what they did

833
01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:05.909
Danny Park: so provide some traceability in the calculations. So when

834
01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:11.650
Danny Park: when the fact that there is a governance or some standard put into place that tells

835
01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:23.439
Danny Park: a a team that, hey? When you're working our standard on this team is if you're working on this type of work paper, you will follow this standard traceability format,

836
01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:37.149
Danny Park: having that rule alone actually provide some comfort into the people who are trying to review this stuff. So they want to review it less because they trust the system more overall. So that's one thing they can do to kind of lower the review points.

837
01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:59.879
crystal.warner: Does that. Does that answer your question, Crystal. Yeah, Yeah, I would say that answers my question, but it does bring up another um, I guess. Quick question. So in reference to that, would you say? Then it's kind of like a manual Um, if that makes sense kind of like a step play by play which would provide that traceability for the higher great question. No, you. So in this, in our current

838
01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:06.889
Danny Park: state of technology, um access accessibility, there will be a project to automate that

839
01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:24.900
Danny Park: because a lot of companies start automating audit like they automate ways to diminish the review points through, you know, like all tracks or so, all tricks for those who have have experiences and those who don't. I kind of explain real quick reason. The value of alterx is that whatever you do,

840
01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:27.179
Danny Park: the source file

841
01:31:27.230 --> 01:31:29.290
Danny Park: is left untouched,

842
01:31:29.590 --> 01:31:30.580
Danny Park: so

843
01:31:30.690 --> 01:31:46.129
Danny Park: you'll have acts the golden source of truth, no matter what right it's like in excel, unless someone hands you the actual go like the file that was never touched. Most people will have access to it. But Ulster X. What it does is it keeps that pristine

844
01:31:46.140 --> 01:32:04.830
Danny Park: and untouched. So you know that you, whatever at the end. If something goes crazy, at least you have the raw data, right? So you kind of trace it back. And what all tricks does is every calculation that it does it all the trails, every single thing, and you could build in rules. Validation rules that give you red flag when something's not going well.

845
01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:06.040
Danny Park: So

846
01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:16.649
Danny Park: there's a several different ways to build it in. You could use ultrax. You could use the actual platforms now. You could build in requirements and platform to, to, to give you the art of trails, but

847
01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:18.980
Danny Park: to crystal. To answer your question,

848
01:32:19.050 --> 01:32:21.420
Danny Park: you should avoid manual, if you can,

849
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:25.910
Danny Park: and always side up always to go to side of automating it.

850
01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:37.540
Danny Park: Um. But if you don't have access to it, then just yeah, you could do a manual, I guess. Yeah,

851
01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:42.840
Danny Park: All right any other questions

852
01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:55.400
Danny Park: awesome folks. So if there are, though, for the questions, I hope everyone had a

853
01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:59.450
Danny Park: obviously a fun session, Hope is interesting. Hopefully, it's helpful.

854
01:32:59.530 --> 01:33:06.630
Danny Park: Um! Have a great Thanksgiving. Have a great weekend, and I will talk to everyone on the other side of Turkey Day.

855
01:33:06.870 --> 01:33:10.519
Danny Park: All right. Have a great um night. Everybody see. Ya,

856
01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:25.669
Nathalie Liquigan: hi, Professor, I was just hoping I can ask you something about the um, the Gap analysis.

857
01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:43.689
Nathalie Liquigan: Yeah. I was just hoping to ask you something about the Gap Analysis. Um, while you're here.
