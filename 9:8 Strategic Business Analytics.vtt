1
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.530
Danny Park: Alright welcome, everyone happy Friday.

2
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.549
Danny Park: if I seem a little down. I had a red red eye flight this morning, so

3
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.780
Danny Park: apologies in advance if I see him a little.

4
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.139
Danny Park: not as energetic as I usually am. Maybe maybe that might be better. I don't know right, anyway.

5
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.560
Danny Park: So

6
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.990
Danny Park: Just before we begin our

7
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:34.300
Danny Park: discussion today around business analytics and strategy. Just wanted to open up the full floor for anyone who has any questions

8
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.740
Danny Park: around the prerecorded lectures

9
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.800
Danny Park: or anything else we covered so far. no one.

10
00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:06.560
Danny Park: Alright sweet, and let's get right into it as I. As we discuss our content today. I'll be referring to. We're referring back to some of the concepts in the pre-recorded lecture.

11
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.609
Danny Park: And if there's any questions, please feel free to raise your hand and stop me any time for me to kind of, you know, elaborate as needed.

12
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:27.989
Danny Park: Alright. So the slide deck II combined our slides from our first session together, just to keep the concept somewhat organized a little bit for our class. So that's not. Let's not worry about slides.

13
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.450
Danny Park: one through 8

14
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.719
Danny Park: for our session today. Oh, Libby, you have a question. Go ahead.

15
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:55.950
libby: It's not really a question. Hi, so when you were talking about consistency with regards to data. Quality just curious. You made mention of an example of a marine somebody that was

16
00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:04.339
libby: stealing 5 cents. I was just curious how much the total amount of money, you know he was charged.

17
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.640
Danny Park: Oh.

18
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.940
Danny Park: I forgot, this is so long ago, but it was a lot.

19
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.140
Danny Park: Yeah, it was. It was less than a million.

20
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.719
libby: Oh, it was yeah, but it was. It was enough to where

21
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.620
Danny Park: he went to jail for very long.

22
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:43.709
Danny Park: and the bad jail. He went to living with military jail, which is not not not a good place for anyone who served before knows the difference between military justice and civilian justice. But yeah, that's something that you know as as future executives in this room we have to. You know.

23
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:55.560
Danny Park: we have to challenge and ask the right questions, even though how minuscule we think it is, you know, is that it was that Colonel who would just like. you know, who's that? He was that diligent

24
00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:07.769
Danny Park: with looking at, you know his paycheck, and that led to. you know, a a criminal activity. I mean discovery of a criminal activity. Aidan. Go ahead.

25
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.150
Aidan(Hun Seok) Choi: Yeah. Well, I was

26
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.130
Aidan(Hun Seok) Choi: Taking your pre recorded lecture. We learned that there's a business model.

27
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.490
Aidan(Hun Seok) Choi: And

28
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:26.550
Aidan(Hun Seok) Choi: with 2 components process model data model, usually some companies, they do not.

29
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.480
Aidan(Hun Seok) Choi: They had a process model that

30
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:35.859
Aidan(Hun Seok) Choi: integrated data model. So the concept also are confused about.

31
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.029
Aidan(Hun Seok) Choi: And the employees are confused about these structures.

32
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.189
Aidan(Hun Seok) Choi: is, those companies considered the the amount of money that

33
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.100
Aidan(Hun Seok) Choi: they're investing or why they're structured like that.

34
00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.390
Danny Park: No, it's a great question.

35
00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:03.590
Danny Park: So in one thing that we have to be very aware of, especially around, you know the world of analytics, and and in the world of big data.

36
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.839
Danny Park: everything has a cost to it, right and to your point.

37
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:27.180
Danny Park: depending on the company, and where they are in the market, they have different priorities. So if you're a market leader. who? Who's has been around for a long time, who has, you know who has these methodologies and funding. Then you really take took care of all these things. But if you're a emerging

38
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:49.250
Danny Park: organization, especially a startup, right? Startups necessarily don't have the funding or capital to really do things the right way, because they have to go show some kind of progress to investors. So I'm not saying that no one's so. And I kinda wanna go into like a myth right in business. People don't purposefully cut costs or or

39
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.909
Danny Park: take shortcuts right.

40
00:04:52.970 --> 00:05:06.350
Danny Park: It's they're forced to do it that way, because there's a laundry list of things that they have to deal with, but but because funding is limited, they have to prioritize what to tackle first, and sometimes some things do get dropped.

41
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.259
Danny Park: but or dropped or done halfway, because, you know, just run out of funding

42
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.059
Danny Park: so as as executives, you know.

43
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.590
Danny Park: we have to, as future executives or executives in the room right now in the room. We have to ensure that

44
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.550
Danny Park: there's enough education within our ranks

45
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:42.249
Danny Park: to where they know that even down to their own activity level, that there has to be some level of priority that takes place. So they make. So their activities or actions, they take generate the most value. So yeah, ultimately, long story short Aiden, it's it's a, it's a, it's a budget issue.

46
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:58.720
Danny Park: And most companies, you know, instead of building data models themselves or robust infrastructures, they just, you know, they they outsource it. Any third party that that that type of capability. But the flip side. What you lose, what you lose is, you know you don't own any of the.

47
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:09.589
Danny Park: you know, like you gotta you gotta. You use what you get kind of thing. So it doesn't really always meet the the requirements. But there's always that trade off the buyer. Sell is a consistent

48
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.099
Danny Park: question that that that we deal with every day.

49
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:22.269
Danny Park: Thank you so much for anyone else. Any other questions.

50
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.070
Danny Park: Awesome. Alright. So let's let's keep chugging along here.

51
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:36.250
Danny Park: Right? So you know, today, just wanna talk about what strategy is. And this is a very

52
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.719
Danny Park: important topic for us to

53
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.120
Danny Park: understand. because

54
00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:50.650
Danny Park: if we don't understand strategy. then the analytics that we do

55
00:06:51.590 --> 00:07:16.080
Danny Park: right, or any decision that we make within our information system, remember the information system. You know the components right? They're going to be misaligned right? So when I go back to the very first slide and you know how we talked about. There's a business strategy and a technology strategy and a talent strategy. And these things start like they diverge, and they sometimes come in conflict.

56
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:26.710
Danny Park: because ultimately, what what binds these 3 strategies together is the ultimate organizational strategy, meaning, what do they really want to achieve?

57
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:34.319
Danny Park: And market? Right? So when we go back to the stratage slide. Right? Let's kind of look through

58
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:43.100
Danny Park: some of the the the definitions and understandings from a book perspective. Right? So strategy refers to a comprehensive

59
00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:54.229
Danny Park: right, comprehensive. That that means something. Okay, a comprehensive and purposeful right? Another word that means something not by accident

60
00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:01.010
Danny Park: and not incomplete right? It's comprehensive and a purposeful plan of action

61
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.460
Danny Park: designed to achieve specific

62
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:18.109
Danny Park: goals and objectives. Right? Remember, as as business leaders, these words, we have to really understand the definition of of these things, we can dilute them or substitute them

63
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:20.999
Danny Park: for other words. Okay.

64
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:38.990
Danny Park: so then, the second line is involved, is making a series of interconnected decisions meaning. You have to understand your information system. You have to understand the the the components of data quality. You have to understand data model. You have to understand your infrastructure

65
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:45.890
Danny Park: right? Because if you don't understand it, how can you make interconnected decisions

66
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:55.650
Danny Park: that align in organization's resources, capabilities and activities with its environment to create a sustainable

67
00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:00.289
Danny Park: right, not just a competitive advantage.

68
00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:13.379
Danny Park: right? A sustainable, competitive advantage. Right? Example like, why is the word sustainable? Very important. And people leave this out often, but we should be including it. Because, for example, let's say I'm in a race with my brother

69
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.039
Danny Park: right? And II

70
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:26.840
Danny Park: happen to have a pair of sneakers that is going to help me run faster. But let's say those pair of sneakers will degrade after 100 yards

71
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:33.069
Danny Park: right? So I'm running, and then my sneak is degraded, and I no longer have the advantage, and my brother catches up.

72
00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:44.619
Danny Park: So basically, the sneakers. The advantage I had was not sustainable didn't last long enough to keep me in a position of leading to where I could leapfrog again.

73
00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:58.170
Danny Park: Right? So you can't claim you're gaining a competitive advantage if you're gonna eventually in the long term, end up where you were in the in the first place. So if you're Number 5, you got to Number one, but because that advantage you you

74
00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:02.890
Danny Park: thought was sustainable was not brought you back back to Number 5. So.

75
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:14.100
Danny Park: understanding the definition of strategy and how interconnected decisions, impact resourcing capability and activities

76
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:24.169
Danny Park: will help us figure out the best possible answer, the best possible competitive advantage and kind of my point around the resources, capabilities and activities. Right?

77
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:41.009
Danny Park: If you don't understand or don't have regard or or consideration of the information system components and how they interact with one another, and you don't have appreciation of data quality, and you don't have appreciation for the infrastructure that captures that quality.

78
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:51.220
Danny Park: How do you know who to hire. How do you know what capabilities you need within your people that you hire, or the technologies you bring in? And how do you even know what activities you should be focused on in the first place.

79
00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:57.190
Danny Park: So sometimes not all the time. Sometimes when we're at work.

80
00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:12.289
Danny Park: we might feel a little lost, or we might feel. We don't understand why we're doing something right for those who work full time. I'm sure you were in a position, or you maybe were in a role where you're doing activities. But you're like, why, the heck, am I doing this stuff

81
00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:15.440
Danny Park: right? That is actually a red flag.

82
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:23.119
Danny Park: So a good strategist a good way to do a pulse check on how

83
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:40.409
Danny Park: comprehensive and purposeful a strategy actually is. You actually go down to the people who are executing your strategy and ask them, Hey, what's the purpose of your activity today? And if they can't articulate it to you, then you have to really start understanding when you really start thinking about. Okay, why does this person not understand?

84
00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:44.720
Danny Park: There has to be a connection and purpose

85
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:52.540
Danny Park: to everything, cause it? Because because top level strategy drives everything down right to the actual tactical level.

86
00:11:53.730 --> 00:12:00.310
Danny Park: So let me stop you any questions. Anyone have any stories around your day to day, and not knowing what's going on.

87
00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:09.270
Danny Park: or even not knowing what some other departments doing, or, which is worse, duplicating efforts in multiple departments.

88
00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.629
Danny Park: These are all signs

89
00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:18.430
Danny Park: that the strategy that a certain group of executives put into place was not comprehensive.

90
00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.889
Danny Park: might not be purposeful.

91
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:29.099
Danny Park: Wasn't there to achieve something specific and didn't really consider the all like, there were no interconnected decisions. Right?

92
00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.239
Danny Park: Any any examples anyone want to share

93
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:39.159
Danny Park: who everyone works for the best company in the world.

94
00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:47.879
Danny Park: Can you hear me? Yeah, go ahead.

95
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.520
Leonard: Oh, so once

96
00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.859
Leonard: I was I was working on this TV show

97
00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.990
Leonard: as a production assistant when I first started.

98
00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:14.100
Leonard: And each, you know, production assistant. We all have the same exact tasks to tackle, but it could be. It could have, like a number of subsections in the task to tackle, and I remember I was just going to get like water and crafty like snacks and things for the crew.

99
00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.010
Leonard: and I came back with

100
00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:21.209
Leonard: the water and the crafty, and someone just around at the same time.

101
00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:38.929
Leonard: Well, more, what is it? More crafty? And they're like, oh, this is more way. More than enough like we didn't know both of you guys were doing the same thing with the communicated to us each that one person should go and do it, and because someone else was doing the same thing that you should go and do another task.

102
00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:43.350
Danny Park: Yeah. No perfect example of just

103
00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:48.389
Danny Park: not everyone not being on the same page as to what

104
00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:56.539
Danny Park: the actual specific goal is right. No great example. And I see another example on on the chat room which I want to read.

105
00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:20.959
Danny Park: By Donald. So I'm very thankful for this commentary. I work as a high school teacher in the South Bronx, and I find it weird how this organized and online teachers are very sensitive topic. But I would have to agree. I would have to agree right. It's because the leaders are not really trying to figure out or spending any time. The teachers understand a new strategy, or they're introducing exactly or

106
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:26.479
Danny Park: right, because perhaps the political nature of academics.

107
00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:32.000
Danny Park: They're competing strategies. They're so

108
00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:48.500
Danny Park: misalign that sometimes you gotta really take a huge step back and figure out what everyone's understanding is that what the actual goals are? Is it just passing kids to make sure they get to the next grade? Or is it actually assessing them for knowledge like, did they actually learn something?

109
00:14:48.500 --> 00:15:08.659
Danny Park: Right? So you have a group that says, well, we don't wanna specifically measure them on how much they learned because the teachers might get a hit in their careers, so the teachers might get blamed that the kids don't know enough. Right? So what's that threshold is passing is 50, is it? 70? Is it 90? What is it versus? You know? What do we even teach them? So so that

110
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:17.469
Danny Park: that right there, that is a great example of how you, if you don't have one specific strategy, right? A specific goal or object objectives

111
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.149
Danny Park: to Donald's point, you don't know who to hire.

112
00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:42.870
Danny Park: You don't know which who which schools should get the most funding or better funding, or should they be actually be funded? You're right. What capabilities do you need to actually get students to teach, to learn, or maybe pass right? And what activities should the teachers be focused on right? Is it teaching toward a state exam, or is it actually teaching with with day to day?

113
00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:55.400
Danny Park:  True care around? What are we learning today? Right day by day, type of type of approach. So great example, the the, the, the academic world. Right?

114
00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.810
Danny Park: Now, thank you for bringing that up.

115
00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:02.220
Danny Park: And then, Barat, I recently started a full time tax social role I used to put in.

116
00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:13.089
Danny Park: I used to input K, one's into tax form. And without actually knowing the pre, yeah, about what numbers mean, and I wasn't an intern I still don't fully know, but definitely have a better idea about K. One's out so.

117
00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:18.359
Danny Park: But Varada has another great example. Right. So in the tax, in the tax industry.

118
00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:26.470
Danny Park: you could go through the tax career. Your entire tax career had no idea

119
00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:32.960
Danny Park: what tax law actually is, and just know that you need to file forms and deadlines.

120
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:38.689
Danny Park: What's sad is the purpose of tax filings

121
00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:47.170
Danny Park: is to motivate companies to do the tax planning before you have to file out at the end of year.

122
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.800
Danny Park: So thoughtful tax planning.

123
00:16:50.710 --> 00:17:07.129
Danny Park: which is a specific goal by you say, I want to be able to save $40,000 off of my net earnings next year. A specific goal leads into what types of forms you need to file, or even if you have to file at all, which saves you more money.

124
00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:14.589
Danny Park: So the lack of a tax strategy would eventually lead lead into having staff

125
00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:26.700
Danny Park: randomly almost feels like randomly filling out forms and filing forms to irs that ultimately should not be needed. because if the strategy was there, in the first place, you don't have to do that stuff

126
00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:31.170
Danny Park: right? So that's a great example. If I brought thank you for that example.

127
00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:52.689
Danny Park: and then Avril, last one and it will move on. I work in banking. I see efforts duplicate and operations several times, multiple reports being duplicated and reinvented, that tell the same story just using different fonts and covid. Yes, yes. So regurgitation of slide decks amongst multiple departments. Right? And

128
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:55.860
Danny Park: and let's think about that for a second, like you have

129
00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:04.809
Danny Park: 3 separate operations. Who are giving you this? Who's giving leadership the same report. So what's going on there?

130
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:14.560
Danny Park: Right? Who's why is it? Why are people confused, or isn't is are the 2 or the other operating bodies, you know, off strategy. So they're doing tasks

131
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:26.550
Danny Park: that they should not be doing should be focused on other things right? So all great examples of how not having a thoughtful and comprehensive strategy is going to misalign like how much waste there is already

132
00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.119
Danny Park: right. Now, let's think about

133
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.369
Danny Park: the analytics behind all that stuff.

134
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:45.500
Danny Park: right? The analytics that you're giving to a leadership with that is absent strategy. How useful is it really right? So

135
00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:52.330
Danny Park: so we talked about some like the bad stuff, right? About what happens if you're not really thoughtful about your strategy, and you're dropping the ball.

136
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:56.070
Danny Park: So luckily there's some criteria

137
00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:59.880
Danny Park: for an effective strategy, right? And the number one on the list

138
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:03.900
Danny Park: is going to be clear, objective.

139
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:26.039
Danny Park: right? Clear objectives. A well. A. So what's a clear objective? Right? A well-defined strategy should have specific, measurable, measurable objectives that guide the organization's efforts. So I'll give. I'll give an example of a poorly, a poor objective right. And this this ha! I actually seen some Mba programs

140
00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:28.250
Danny Park: when they write mission statements.

141
00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:39.399
Danny Park: And I'm reading. I go. Well, that's a really poorly written mission statement as a bad example. And I've seen it at Barook, too. Right? So here's a really bad mission statement or a bad objective or strategy.

142
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:45.890
Danny Park: Next year we're going to increase our market share in the finance industry.

143
00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.120
Danny Park: Okay.

144
00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:53.430
Danny Park: so can anyone tell me what's wrong with that.

145
00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:58.749
Leonard: Yeah, there's no clear directive as to

146
00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:03.199
Leonard: how when? Exactly. Yes.

147
00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:09.310
Leonard: And yeah, basically how. And when. Exactly. So, you could hold people accountable.

148
00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:20.959
Danny Park: awesome way to measure that Yup. So what happens? What happens to like? So let's say you give that to your say. You're a CEO, and you see that in some meeting.

149
00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:24.359
Danny Park: and that's a takeaway. Oh, take away blah! Right

150
00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:29.930
Danny Park: and then, and then the the senior Vice Presidents have to go plan around this thing.

151
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:38.959
Danny Park: Then that put your put yourself in the shoes of a senior vice President who's expected to plan around a plan for

152
00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:41.130
Danny Park: that objective?

153
00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:46.359
Danny Park: Wha wha think about? What will you do like? What resources do you need?

154
00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:50.929
Danny Park: What team was? Specifics? Yeah, exactly. And then but what happens? Though?

155
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.979
Danny Park: Because things so move so fast, what do they do? They

156
00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:56.970
Danny Park: duplicate efforts

157
00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:05.159
Danny Park: right? They hire more than they need, they gain. They bring on capabilities that other departments already have.

158
00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:08.419
Danny Park: and they're doing the same activities.

159
00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:32.159
Danny Park: So you have this massive effort to charge or march towards something that they do have no idea what they're marching toward. That example of an objective, that high, level thing that I've seen examples of that too many times, both in, you know, in my client work and and everywhere else, right? And what's set? What's gonna set us us apart differently in our careers is when we hear vague, we challenge it with the right questions.

160
00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:51.430
Danny Park: And why do we challenge it with the right questions, because we are and where we want to be really good, analytic people, right? So analytic people need to answer need to ask the right questions. So so challenging through questions is what highlights us for potential leadership, or, in fact, leadership in the future, and leadership is not

161
00:21:52.230 --> 00:22:00.119
Danny Park: a very difficult thing to do is just having the courage to inspire people just by asking the right questions. Sometimes it's that easy.

162
00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:06.179
Danny Park: So here's a a good. Can someone give an example of a good objective?

163
00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.319
Danny Park: You can make one up. You don't have to use the example I just gave before.

164
00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:16.250
Leonard: A good objective would probably be something like

165
00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:22.210
Leonard: and the next 3 months I choose. I I'm going to

166
00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:25.650
Leonard: produce produce the album right by making

167
00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:30.469
Leonard: 3 songs every 2 weeks or every 3 weeks.

168
00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:39.869
Leonard: And you know, I'm gonna make one song a week. Let's say I'm gonna make one song a week for the next 3 to 4 months to produce an album that has 11 to 12 cuts on it.

169
00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:40.790
Oh.

170
00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:45.390
Danny Park: nice like that. Yeah, which results in which results in

171
00:22:45.960 --> 00:23:15.230
Leonard: how much money like, let's use like 10 million dollars or 5 million depends on who you are. Yeah, it could be like, Oh, in sales, you. We wanna say something like, Oh, in that album I'm gonna try to produce, maybe a hundred $1,000 in sales in the following 3 months. So over total of 6 months. I'm gonna produce the album of 1112 songs that's going to gone to me. At least 100,000 in sales.

172
00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:37.469
Danny Park: perfect sort of total 6 months. Yeah, that's that's a really good example. So what Leonard is providing is so so to sum up, what a clear objective is supposed to do. What a clear objective does is. It tells everyone who's leading a the value chain of an organization. It shows them exactly what they need to do

173
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:47.460
Danny Park: to participate in achievement of the of the objective of the of the objective. So what I heard from Leonard is right. If I had executive from so, but from procurement.

174
00:23:47.640 --> 00:24:01.909
Danny Park: a executive from marketing, an executive, from finance, and executive from Hr. Talent. When they hear that objective they're gonna, go. Oh, I know. II know what my role is. Now in that objective.

175
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:12.009
Danny Park: I'm gonna start thinking about what resources and capabilities and plans I need. And I know who to talk to, to collaborate, to make sure that we're not stepping on each other's toes.

176
00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:14.990
Danny Park: So you see how powerful that is in business.

177
00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:25.359
Danny Park: right? Business is not some magical, difficult thing to do where you need to be to the you need to be a wizard. It just takes some analytical thought, thinking like an analyst.

178
00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:37.990
Danny Park: to to cover or be thorough or comprehensive, right and purposeful in the things that we want to achieve. Right. And that's what that's what separates a

179
00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:42.360
Danny Park: an Mba from everyone else. Right?

180
00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:57.259
Danny Park: So then, that we talked about to getting that alignment right? So the example about all the executives and the different value chain know exactly what they did. They're all aligned on what they're supposed to do right, and because they're aligned

181
00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:11.869
Danny Park: and not stepping on each other's toes and not wasting time and costing more money. Because what happens when you're when you're over producing, or you're reproducing things that already produced, you're just wasting time and money.

182
00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:16.799
Danny Park: If you waste time and money, you can't gain it like a competitive advantage.

183
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:36.590
Danny Park: So the alignment which creates efficiencies and achieving those objectives, objectives increases your probability of achieving the competitive advantage. So that's what, when you guys here in your classes like this high level term that professors throughout and gaining the competitive advantage. That's that's like we're pinned the layer back.

184
00:25:36.860 --> 00:26:02.399
Danny Park: And now we're starting to learn. Okay, what? What do they mean by that like? Well, how do you get it like? What do they mean? Oh, it's simple. Have a have a comprehensive, purposeful strategy. So people can align their activities and resource and capabilities. So once they're line and working together and collaborating something great's gonna come out of it. And it's gonna be very efficient and least way, so they can go ahead and take the money they save of being efficient. And to further that project to continue to strive toward the same strategy.

185
00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:06.969
Danny Park: How many people in this room who work for a company. How many times have you heard of strategy shifting?

186
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:15.780
Danny Park: You have to answer? But I would tell you in this room there probably plenty plenty of you who are told. Wait, stop doing that. We're doing something else

187
00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:17.710
Danny Park: right? Lena. Go ahead. Yeah.

188
00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:27.119
Leonard: no. I was just answering your question. I have. I've been a part of shifting strategy as well as having to pivot my own strategy.

189
00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:34.390
Danny Park: Yes, and which is causes more ripple effects. So so that's what again, like, that's what

190
00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:44.110
Danny Park: this this this gem of understanding strategy is. Gonna start. We're gonna start building into how it's gonna make the analytics

191
00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:48.959
Danny Park: that much more purposeful and useful, right?

192
00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:57.250
Danny Park: And I just wanna just kinda I'll and I'll keep hounding on this topic right? The soft skills

193
00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:01.400
Danny Park: and the rigor and discipline around them.

194
00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:05.649
Danny Park: It gives birth to strong analytics.

195
00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:09.190
Danny Park: Analytics

196
00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:12.650
Danny Park: does not birth strong strategy

197
00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.660
Danny Park: right? And I see that misunderstanding

198
00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:25.189
Danny Park: not often, but I see it. But people say, Oh, just have an analytics program. They'll solve your problems. I go. What? What?

199
00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:33.129
Danny Park: So you're analyzing the fact that you don't have a strategy like, what? How is that? Gonna solve the fact that you don't have a strategy?

200
00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:43.090
Danny Park: Alright. So we have to understand that that business analytics is, and we'll go back. You know that going back to the slide. But always we know we revisit the topic.

201
00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:49.059
Danny Park: Business analytics is a combination of really good business analysis and really good data analytics

202
00:27:49.090 --> 00:28:10.049
Danny Park: right and bit, the the discipline and business analysis helps us strive toward this comprehensive and purposeful strategy. So then, we have where we're going to march toward the competitive advantage because we have alignment, we have effective and efficient resource allocation. Then, because we have the proper resources, then we can be flexible.

203
00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:20.979
Danny Park: Agility and flexibility cannot be gained without the proper, not the proper resources staffed with the right capabilities, doing the right activities

204
00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:27.409
Danny Park: right. Agility means pivoting, finding a business problem very quickly and solving it.

205
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:33.860
Danny Park: That's flexibility and agility, right? It doesn't mean you pivot quickly and do a different strategy. That means you failed.

206
00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:44.870
Danny Park: That means that strategy. One strategy failed. You're doing another one. So people confuse that, too. And I want to comment. Go back and kind of restell that myth. When you're shifting strategies, you're not being agile or flexible.

207
00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.729
Danny Park: It means that there's something all for the strategy. In the first place.

208
00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:54.499
Danny Park: What flexibility and agility means is you're marching toward a clear objective

209
00:28:55.570 --> 00:29:01.549
Danny Park: right? And then a a, a unknown business problem. Surfaces.

210
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:10.199
Danny Park: Since you have the right resource and capabilities, capabilities already staffed, you have the ability to to work around.

211
00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:16.079
Danny Park: circumvent or eliminate that business problem, to continue on the march toward the strategy you have in place.

212
00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:20.059
Danny Park: right? The best products we have in this world.

213
00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:25.249
Danny Park: That's why we have them right, like the iphone.

214
00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.139
Danny Park: like

215
00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:35.870
Danny Park: satellites. Right? All these big box great technologies because we they had a effective strategy going into it

216
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:41.109
Danny Park: right? And then there is always a long-term perspective.

217
00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:51.129
Danny Park: Right? Short term successes keep you on the long-term path

218
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:55.080
Danny Park: for sustained success.

219
00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:08.780
Danny Park: Alright! And going to Donald, I see you have another great comment there. So let me share this every single student who graduated from the ABC. School attend a full university graduate debt free with 4. Yes.

220
00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.350
Danny Park: very good, exactly. So

221
00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:15.159
Danny Park: that another example of a very good, clear objective.

222
00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:24.139
Danny Park: So the principal, the teachers, the Deans. They know exactly what levers to pull and how to organize themselves, to achieve those specific goals.

223
00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.950
Danny Park: awesome any questions around strategy.

224
00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:38.610
Danny Park: A good, a good ex. A good practice of this is actually your Mba curriculums. Right? So

225
00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:46.719
Danny Park: what is the purpose like? What is the strategy for the Mba.

226
00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:56.190
Danny Park: Right? So everyone should have a strategy as to like a like, you know, their strategy is you want to work for? You want to work in the finance industry

227
00:30:56.340 --> 00:31:06.660
Danny Park: within 3 months of graduation for these companies in this role. And I want to be paid this much or compensation range

228
00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:17.180
Danny Park: right without those specific things defined. What ends up happening is you're gonna go through your curriculum picking courses that you don't know why you're picking them.

229
00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:25.379
Danny Park: Well, you're guessing your thing is gonna help you. But maybe you won't right. And at the end, when you graduate from Mba programs.

230
00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:36.419
Danny Park: instead of targeting and doing the actions to specifically get you set you set up for success to get the career that you want. You end up taking the first job that comes across.

231
00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:40.629
Danny Park: I seen that happen a lot.

232
00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:53.179
Danny Park: And it's because we have to bring these concepts into our daily lives. The more we practice these concepts in our daily lives, the more we can showcase them in our work life.

233
00:31:53.540 --> 00:32:01.920
Danny Park: that is, work-life balance. or a a portion of what we define as work-life balance.

234
00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:05.560
Danny Park: Okay, Tayla tailor

235
00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:22.370
Taeeun: so I was kinda curious about something. So let's say, in real life situations, not all strategies can be perfect.

236
00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.770
Taeeun: Therefore.

237
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:42.290
Taeeun: if let's say it's like a really long term strategy with like, 3 year span. When does like companies will realize actually make the changes would decide. Oh, you have to fix our strategy or our strategy isn't the best. Oh, sure, no great, great question. So

238
00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:55.719
Danny Park: strategies. Good. Good St. The top companies build or or develop really comprehensive, purposeful strategies

239
00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:00.050
Danny Park: where they will, will, they'll start pivoting is

240
00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:05.459
Danny Park: if the erratic and uncontrollable nature of the economy

241
00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.950
Danny Park: surfaces, thumb aspect

242
00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:18.250
Danny Park: that they could not control, for which did not inform this strategy. In the first place. So it's a great question that Taylor brought up right is

243
00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:21.869
Danny Park: when you, when you build a strategy.

244
00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:26.589
Danny Park: you're you're using the best information you have to date

245
00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:35.720
Danny Park: to build out a strategy that is achievable. But we have to understand as business leaders that we work in the capitalist market

246
00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:46.629
Danny Park: where there's a lot of uncontrollable unpredict, unpredictable factors. So as we're marching toward our strategy, we have, you know, most companies have wings.

247
00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:56.560
Danny Park: strategic wings in the in the organization called R&D, right research and development or business intelligence. Right? So these parts of the companies are always scouring

248
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:59.870
Danny Park: the the, the ecosystem

249
00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:06.350
Danny Park: for lagging and leading indicators that might be contrary

250
00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:09.670
Danny Park: to the strategy that they have created

251
00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.410
Danny Park: right. So that function

252
00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:24.709
Danny Park: is what informs the organization. As to hey, we need to shift this to strategy, in other words, develop a updated, comprehensive, purposeful strategy, because these new factors have emerged.

253
00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:26.159
Danny Park: So

254
00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:31.390
Danny Park: if we think about it right, let's this business intelligence function

255
00:34:31.449 --> 00:34:36.089
Danny Park: and this R&D function. how do they know what to scour for

256
00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:49.620
Danny Park: or scan, for in the environment meaning which lagging, which lagging, lead, meeting indicators to look for if the strategy is not comprehensive, purpose, comprehensive and purposeful, if it's, you know, like very loosely defined

257
00:34:49.639 --> 00:35:02.920
Danny Park: and not connected right, they will not know what to look for. So even that function is just going to be spinning in circles, and is wasting money, thinking and saying, Hey, I think this is going to affect the strategy. No, that no, this no, that.

258
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:08.320
Danny Park: So to answer Taylor. Your question strategies will shift. but

259
00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:16.970
Danny Park: the the size of it it needing to have to shift depends on how well the strategy was developed in the first place, and based on what data

260
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:19.860
Danny Park: right? And the more

261
00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:26.959
Danny Park: the the the the more poor the quality the strategy is, the more

262
00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.820
Danny Park: my monumentalist shift is going to be right.

263
00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:39.050
Danny Park: So that's like that. That's how it out. Answer your question. Does does that help Taylor? Yes, that's only helps much more sense. Thank you. You're welcome.

264
00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:42.749
Danny Park: So so. And and that business intelligence

265
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:51.030
Danny Park: function is actually an analytical function, right? But the point is. strategy defines purpose for everybody

266
00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:56.950
Danny Park: in the organization. And if we don't understand why we exist

267
00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:03.099
Danny Park: right. we're really, really, really wasting time and money like, that's the only way we can actually think about it.

268
00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:10.379
Danny Park: Right? So great question. so kind of moving on doing a little time check is almost 6 30.

269
00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:16.900
Danny Park: So kind of going back to, you know, I wanted to go back to this slide and talk about strat strategy. Right?

270
00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:18.520
Danny Park: So

271
00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:30.200
Danny Park: the strategy, if you want to think about it in one picture. It's aligning these things together. Right on the left-hand side

272
00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:32.770
Danny Park: is the strategic portfolio.

273
00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:37.060
Danny Park: right and the right hand side of the operations.

274
00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:44.079
Danny Park: and very comprehensive and purposeful, purposeful strategies

275
00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.339
Danny Park: are going to inform operations

276
00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:51.440
Danny Park: on where to go and what to measure.

277
00:36:52.090 --> 00:37:03.820
Danny Park: and as they're performing and doing the right activities when they see errors or opportunities. Those errors or opportunities are the the actually the ones that are going to add the most value

278
00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:12.959
Danny Park: because they have purpose right? There's purpose behind them now. So then, since you have purpose behind them, the special projects that you create

279
00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:21.259
Danny Park: are going to really add value and provide you a deliverable that you could really gain a competitive advantage on. So.

280
00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:31.009
Danny Park: for example, using example, to explain this, how many projects have you guys been on those in this room where, at the end of the project, whatever is delivered was never used.

281
00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:36.630
Danny Park: Anyone. Have anyone listen to that?

282
00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:40.289
Danny Park: They went through like 3 to 4 or 5 month project.

283
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:53.200
Danny Park: working, working, working, confused entire time, had no idea what everyone else was doing, chugging through, trying to meet deadlines. Things were delayed coming back, and at the end you deliver something, and you deliver, and all of a sudden you never hear about it again.

284
00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:55.290
Danny Park: Ariana.

285
00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:11.359
Erania (EJ) Johnson: or or Rainy? Sorry. Yeah, I was just raising my hand so that I do that, my team and I. We're working on our organization, and I would write up a whole blueprint slides everything, and then we never go through with it.

286
00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:21.419
Danny Park: Yeah. Yeah. And and that would that would be infuriating. Cause you. Yeah, you go through all that effort. You're putting all the intellect all the time behind it, and then and then the company's saying.

287
00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:34.529
Danny Park: Nope, I don't know what the company like. They they come like a company is confused. Leadership's confused because they don't know what they want. That's a great example. Yeah. Yeah.

288
00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:41.520
Danny Park: Great. Thank you for sharing. Ej, I'll call you. Ej, okay? So then, okay, great. Thank you. Okay. And then Libby, go ahead.

289
00:38:42.590 --> 00:39:10.249
libby: Oh, yeah. So I work in healthcare. as a nurse and a lot of the time we come together to do things to make change. And it's it's it's annoying, especially because they want us to come together and do project. But then you find out that there's a conflict between leadership and the Union under which the nurses work on.

290
00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:17.089
Danny Park: Hmm good example. So there was no strategic alignment within the third parties within the ecosystem.

291
00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:20.960
Danny Park: So there's no true partnership, and let me bring up a good point.

292
00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:32.220
Danny Park: Business partnerships the road, because each side we're confused as to what the actual strategy is right. If there is no one comprehensive and you know and thoughtful directive strategy.

293
00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:35.790
Danny Park: How can different companies come together and work together?

294
00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:41.169
Danny Park: Right? And that's a really great example, especially around third party contractors.

295
00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:51.360
Danny Park: And that's why, if anyone who's got really good experience managing contractors is a huge, huge opportunity for many industries for those who actually have that skill set Aidan. Go ahead.

296
00:39:52.790 --> 00:40:00.069
Aidan(Hun Seok) Choi:  I was working as a internal auditor a few years ago. I was in

297
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:06.519
Aidan(Hun Seok) Choi: project to build a automation system in excel by using Vpas

298
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:15.209
Aidan(Hun Seok) Choi: the project has to stop because the complexity of the code that we are using was unable to understand

299
00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:20.509
Aidan(Hun Seok) Choi: the executives and our eyes. So we gotta stop the project.

300
00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:22.900
Danny Park: Hmm, good one. So

301
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:29.599
Danny Park: because the technical experts who are supposed to be vetting the code for usefulness and feasibility.

302
00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:33.509
Danny Park: we're not understanding the direction of

303
00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:40.770
Danny Park: the strategy behind. Why, they're developing it just didn't care enough to ask to the due diligence which ended up you doing a lot of work

304
00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:50.040
Danny Park: and getting to a point where it wasn't feasible because they weren't ready for it. The classic product development example that you just gave Eden awesome

305
00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:54.060
Danny Park: and then Kudrat.

306
00:40:54.290 --> 00:41:11.320
Qudrat_ullah Yousufi: Yep. Professor, I have a question about the map, the portfolio. I have noticed that there's some become project while there are something that first they became program, then become project. Oh, sorry, no, no! So great question. So what? The so up? So this is. This isn't saying

307
00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:25.110
Danny Park: sorry I should explain this. So this figure on the left. It's not saying portfolio turns into something. What this is saying is. So the portfolio, a company's portfolio is made up of projects and programs.

308
00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:38.219
Danny Park: So that's all this is saying so when you look at when you look at like when you look at the strategic portfolio. You're gonna have a collection of programs and projects that have to work together to achieve the strategic vision.

309
00:41:38.670 --> 00:42:03.529
Danny Park: So like, for me, it's a confusion like the difference between the program and the project. Yeah, yeah, yeah, so I should. Yeah, my apolog. And then the program, the definition of a program is more than one related is more than one related project where all the projects have to work together, that each of the deliverables from that project has to be aggregated to result in program success.

310
00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:11.159
Danny Park: So so it's not one leading to the other. It's just bucketing, showing the definition of each thing.

311
00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:12.140
Danny Park: But

312
00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:25.659
Danny Park: I just want to make a point about that. Right? So let's say you have a strategic portfolio, right? And we define that a portfolio is a collection of projects and programs that have to be related and work together

313
00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:29.400
Danny Park: together to achieve their strategic vision.

314
00:42:29.410 --> 00:42:39.360
Danny Park: So if we don't have a clear strategic vision. it runs a risk of having projects and programs that have no relation to one another.

315
00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:41.840
Danny Park: which then

316
00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:49.420
Danny Park: just has to our point. Before you do a project, you have a deliverable, and no one cares about it.

317
00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:54.229
Danny Park: Right? So these, all these things right.

318
00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.450
Danny Park: these.

319
00:42:56.060 --> 00:43:02.639
Danny Park: what we discussed so far that Boston class have gone through these are older red flags.

320
00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:15.180
Danny Park: That gives us an idea that the organization can get some improvement on this strategy. So a good way for us to make a good name for ourselves, right? Brand ourselves as a next leadership. Right is to just call it out

321
00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:17.539
Danny Park: is just to be aware

322
00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:23.670
Danny Park: that you see these red flags, and you ask the right questions. Essling, go ahead.

323
00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:29.990
Danny Park: S. Line. Sorry if I push you that name.

324
00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:37.180
Esaline Jarvis: Yes, so I just wanted to share about some experience. I also have myself and

325
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:41.739
Esaline Jarvis: 3 other colleagues or tabs who create innovation lab.

326
00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:52.840
Esaline Jarvis: where we had other employees of our department participant to come up with equal ideas on how to do different processes, and and so on.

327
00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:58.599
Esaline Jarvis: And it I mean, it took months for us to plan this, and to bring it off.

328
00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:00.000
Esaline Jarvis: And then

329
00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:08.630
Esaline Jarvis: it happened. Some great ideas came out of it, and the Vp. Was ready to implement these new ideas.

330
00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.890
Esaline Jarvis: and then, unfortunately, covet happened.

331
00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:17.600
Esaline Jarvis: And so that derailed everything.

332
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:20.300
Esaline Jarvis: Some of the ideas were never

333
00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:24.420
Esaline Jarvis: you know. activated or put in place.

334
00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:27.330
Danny Park: Wow! No great example.

335
00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:31.530
Danny Park: I mean. It's another example of that misalignment. Right? It's

336
00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:45.899
Danny Park: and I and I and I and and I ask for a class, the class members to speak up and share their experiences. Because I just want to show everyone how prevalent this is. So to an Mba

337
00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:48.339
Danny Park: problems or opportunities.

338
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:57.760
Danny Park: Right? So keep keep that in mind. So every the problems that you feel at work, the opportunities for you to to, for you to help, solve

339
00:44:57.790 --> 00:45:01.580
Danny Park: and don't shy away from it, cause no one else is doing it, as you can see.

340
00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:08.150
Danny Park: so great great examples. Everyone I love the participation. It's it's really eye opening.

341
00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:14.099
Danny Park: so kind of moving off for the sake of time. Because I don't. I think our first session I went like 15 min past.

342
00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.920
Danny Park: So

343
00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:23.439
Danny Park: we are now. We are now understanding why, strategy is very important. Okay? So then.

344
00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:35.379
Danny Park: once we get a good comprehensive strategy, and then we have the resources and capabilities, and we have everything, all those lined up. We can't forget about the data.

345
00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:44.669
Danny Park: right? And this is kind of piggybacking off of our data quality pre-recorded lecture. But I kind of revisit it from a different lens.

346
00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:47.679
Danny Park: because, especially in this day and age.

347
00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:53.589
Danny Park: if we don't have or we don't have, a understanding of how.

348
00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:54.690
Danny Park: how.

349
00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:04.640
Danny Park: how useful our organizational data is we really can't create a strategy.

350
00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:14.330
Danny Park: Because data is like data is now gold, right? It's a new oil, right? So what we're going to go through is what we call the essential elements of data.

351
00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:19.500
Danny Park: right or the 5 essential elements for succeeding with data.

352
00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:29.670
Danny Park: So we see we have data quality as as the one. Right, we'll go through that really quickly, because we already went through it in a pre-recorded lecture. But there are 4 other elements

353
00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:37.229
Danny Park: of of succeeding with data that organizations or most organizations are not really thinking about

354
00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:42.800
Danny Park: right. And what this left hand chart is showing you is.

355
00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:51.010
Danny Park: if you're if you're not considering one of these elements. it's gonna cause that

356
00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:58.950
Danny Park: inefficiency on the right. So when one element is missing right here, when one element is missing. So the first I was saying is.

357
00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:01.469
if you don't have good data quality.

358
00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:19.929
Danny Park: but you have the means to monetize, we'll go over that shortly. What that means. And if you have the organizational capability to use data right? And you have the technologies to process the data, and you would have the policies and pace to defend or secure your data right?

359
00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:21.610
Danny Park: Having

360
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:30.780
Danny Park: misalignment or a a a or poor data quality. It's gonna it's gonna result in high costs and difficulty

361
00:47:31.290 --> 00:47:38.329
Danny Park: right? And you can read the rest right? So the second row saying that if you have everything except for means to monetize, then you have little business benefit

362
00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:48.659
Danny Park: because data is gold. Everything that we have that every data point that we're generating in our organization is knowledge for us to use to run in our analytics.

363
00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:50.110
Danny Park: right?

364
00:47:50.320 --> 00:48:01.580
Danny Park: That that the the fact that we might be missing so organizational capability using data if we're missing the capability to use the data that we're generating.

365
00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:07.129
Danny Park: Right? We're we're not gonna be able to scale. We're just gonna we're just gonna have bunch of silos

366
00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:17.549
Danny Park: right? And if we don't have the technologies to process data, we actually result in the same type of problem. But just this was just more, more more prevalent

367
00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:26.889
Danny Park: right? And then, if we can't secure our data meaning. We'll have methodologies and practices and procedures in place to secure our data.

368
00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:35.689
Danny Park: Is it cost us time, money, and trouble? So we all know what happens. We get hacked right. Brand diminishes exponentially

369
00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:38.620
Danny Park: and

370
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:40.310
Danny Park: to erect

371
00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:43.039
Danny Park: right, or establish

372
00:48:43.990 --> 00:49:01.470
Danny Park: these mechanisms to ensure that we have the 5 essential essential elements of succeeding with data. It requires a, a, a thoughtful data strategy that you see on the right hand side. So we'll we have a whole section, A, a session, dedicated data strategy. So I'll go over it here. But

373
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:06.609
Danny Park: similar to our definition of strategy in general.

374
00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:11.080
Danny Park: these same definitions.

375
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:22.590
Danny Park: we're understandings of what good strategy is has to carry over to our data strategy. Just because it's data strategies. I mean that our definition of what good strategies is is suspended.

376
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:26.539
Danny Park: Okay, it still needs to be comprehensive.

377
00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:32.329
Danny Park: robust. specific. measurable. All those things we talked about

378
00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:40.480
Danny Park: right? And sometimes that's what ends up happening. Right? So I'll kind of go in a little tangent here. And we talk about these, these these strategies right?

379
00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:53.809
Danny Park: Depending on the the wisdom of the executive or leadership running a particular strategy. Some might not be so good, and they might have a technology strategy as that's not really specific

380
00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:56.120
Danny Park: and aligned

381
00:49:56.340 --> 00:50:07.089
Danny Park: right? Whereas the business strategy might be so. That's another cause. That might be another cause of the misalignment that we talked about. So we have to understand that, you know there could be several ways or reasons why a strategy goes off rails.

382
00:50:07.410 --> 00:50:09.980
Danny Park: Okay. so next slide here.

383
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:27.240
Danny Park: just quality data. I know we did the 6 V's in our pre-recorded session. This is a decomposed list of the essential, qual essential quality elements of data. Right? You'll see some that you recognize. But there's some that are a little bit expanded upon

384
00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:41.420
Danny Park: right things like interoperability, metadata. contextual data validity. So when you guys have time definitely read over it, I'm not gonna go through each everyone for exam purposes. All we have to understand is that

385
00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:47.770
Danny Park: we as business leaders. we have to challenge

386
00:50:48.520 --> 00:51:02.419
Danny Park: the quality of the data we have in the firm we have to always be. We have to work with our data experts to find ways to test our data, to ensure that every element of data quality exists within our data sets

387
00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:10.020
Danny Park: alright. And as examples, anyone wants to use it

388
00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:16.860
Danny Park: at work for sure feel free to use slide 14 slide 14. So

389
00:51:17.170 --> 00:51:26.450
Danny Park: when I talked about testing the quality of your data, right? So slide 14 is something that I've used in my career to challenge

390
00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:32.619
Danny Park: my data experts when they tell me that our quality is good.

391
00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:33.910
Danny Park: So

392
00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:37.200
Danny Park: you know a a business way to actually

393
00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:54.239
Danny Park: test it or challenge that notion is to run a diagnostic right? So what you see on the left hand side is my it's a high level. I didn't put my full project plan because that would just be slides upon slides. But I just put the high level project plan on the left hand side. So basically, the steps

394
00:51:54.490 --> 00:52:03.939
Danny Park: in milestone format right? So you do these. This would be the milestones of your diagnostic data diagnostic program. Program

395
00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:10.710
Danny Park: on the left hand side, the steps that you take right first milestone one. You want to define the data strategy and the objectives. Right?

396
00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:12.600
Danny Park: Even though you're testing

397
00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:14.630
Danny Park: right?

398
00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:23.969
Danny Park: You still have to clarify the data strategy. Right? You have to kind of go back and say, Hey, let's do a goal. Revisit our data strategy. Was it actually good?

399
00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:26.440
Danny Park: In the first place.

400
00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:39.570
Danny Park: right? Cause they'll tell you. If you get a data strategy where it's like yo, it's not comprehensive. It's not purposeful. It's like I had no idea what's going on. Then you would know your th, the claim that you have quality data.

401
00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:43.009
Danny Park: How can you have quality data.

402
00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:47.549
Danny Park: right? Timeliness? For example.

403
00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:51.140
Danny Park: if you don't have specifics? How do you know when you need the data?

404
00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:56.349
Danny Park: So if you don't know when you need the data, how can you claim that you have timeliness in your data sets.

405
00:52:57.250 --> 00:53:11.860
Danny Park: You can't right? So that's that's just one example. So that's where you start, is you? You you. You revisit data strategy. You test it to see if it meets the litmus test for it being a good comprehensive strategy. Right? Then you go into stakeholder engagement

406
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:23.080
Danny Park: right? You want to talk and interview every person who's involved the responsible data quality and see if they understand the data strategy. It's a Jeff objectives.

407
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:28.219
Danny Park: because if they don't understand or we're not told what the data strategy objectives are.

408
00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:31.909
Danny Park: Most likely the activities that they're carrying out.

409
00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:34.400
Danny Park: We're wasteful. And

410
00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:41.419
Danny Park: we can't conclude that the data that they were in charge of is of good quality or aligned to the business of the data strategy.

411
00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:56.679
Danny Park: Right? Then, you want to do a data inventory right? In other words, just collect and create a data dictionary and see if the data dictionary makes sense. Right? You built out a data dictionary and see if all the elements are there

412
00:53:57.690 --> 00:54:00.470
Danny Park: especially metadata and contextual data?

413
00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:06.970
Danny Park: Right?

414
00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:22.609
Danny Park: Then, you go right into defining your data quality metrics and goals that like, basically, what does success look like? So when what are we going to use to say? Yes, all these data points and our our our data, our data is of good quality.

415
00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:28.059
Danny Park: Then you go right into your data quality assessments. So milestone 5. So this is a project plan on the left.

416
00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:36.589
Danny Park: during the milestone events. The right-hand side are some of the business analytical questions that we want to ask.

417
00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:40.199
Danny Park: Oh, Audi, I already caught a little typo here

418
00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:41.710
that should be

419
00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:57.900
Danny Park: awesome, too. Alright! So these are the questions that you could ask, or you should ask, as you're going through each of these milestones

420
00:54:58.070 --> 00:55:12.750
Danny Park: on here. So the diagnostic questions I only gave a a sample of it. There's there's a lot more, but I'm giving. I provided the most like I in my mind why, I would view as the most important questions that I definitely need to ask my stakeholders.

421
00:55:16.210 --> 00:55:18.380
Danny Park: Right? Slide 14.

422
00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:23.410
Danny Park: This this approach, and enable the success

423
00:55:23.650 --> 00:55:28.230
Danny Park: of the automation set of excellence that that I helped stand up.

424
00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:31.470
Danny Park: And in my current organization

425
00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:39.860
Danny Park: cause to do automation and machine learning and analytics, you have to have quality data.

426
00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:50.889
Danny Park: right? And this is a really good slide. Again. You guys are more than happy to use it and take it as your own. Modify it to your current business problem of projects, and just share it with

427
00:55:51.320 --> 00:56:01.299
Danny Park: whoever you report to your boss, your manager, whoever. and I would think I would just assume that most of them are not thinking this way

428
00:56:05.050 --> 00:56:19.310
Danny Park: because they're not in a world class. Mba. Program. Alright, alright. Kind of going on more more. It's so. It actually, there's a couple of slides indicate I won't go to each one right? So the full. The full diagnostic plan

429
00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:22.190
Danny Park: is slides 1415, and 16.

430
00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:28.410
Danny Park: So I'll stop here for a second any questions or any comments

431
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:30.680
Danny Park: any stories people want to share.

432
00:56:38.490 --> 00:56:41.400
Danny Park: Alright. If not, I'll move, keep going

433
00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:50.579
Danny Park: alright. So means to monus monetize right? One of the essential elements of working with data. We're at a point in our

434
00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:59.460
Danny Park:  revolution, right? Industry 4.0

435
00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:04.110
Danny Park: where for many companies

436
00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:06.410
Danny Park: to

437
00:57:06.970 --> 00:57:13.789
Danny Park: continue to establish a competitive advantage. We have to find ways to monetize our data.

438
00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:15.980
Danny Park: okay.

439
00:57:16.130 --> 00:57:16.920
and

440
00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:24.299
Danny Park: to monetize our data. We need a couple of elements to it.

441
00:57:24.330 --> 00:57:29.709
Danny Park: Right. And what I'm listing here are the elements that we should see within the organization.

442
00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:37.339
Danny Park: You could call in capabilities, too. It could be it to change. But we should see most of these within the organization

443
00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:41.040
Danny Park: that signals that they're ready to monetize their data

444
00:57:41.490 --> 00:57:49.960
Danny Park: if we're missing these like, say, you guys who are working in on your organizations. And if you ask around the data, the data groups and you go, hey.

445
00:57:50.030 --> 00:58:00.329
Danny Park: do you have a data monetization data, monetization model, and they look at you like, what the hell is that, then? Most likely your company or organization is not ready to monetize any of its data.

446
00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:05.879
Danny Park: So these are good flags for us as executives to use

447
00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:16.740
Danny Park: or use them to ask questions, to see, hey? Are we ready yet to? To to make money off our data? If not, where is the gap? So what are we missing? And then what do we need

448
00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:19.720
Danny Park: to fill that gap

449
00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:25.300
Danny Park: right? And there's some really big ones. Right? For example, one data strategy.

450
00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:44.339
Danny Park: So I. So in my career thus far again, it's just one career. I would ask everyone in this room to ask others. that you that you know, who have, you know, consulting or data, or or technology, or whatever careers, right in my career.

451
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:48.780
Danny Park: I have seen organizations.

452
00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:55.569
Danny Park: I'm trying to say it in a like a political way. Okay? More often than not.

453
00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:59.139
Danny Park: I did not see a data strategy.

454
00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:02.250
Danny Park: I saw a technology strategy.

455
00:59:02.770 --> 00:59:09.420
Danny Park: But I did not see a specific data one. right? And that's that's surprising.

456
00:59:09.650 --> 00:59:30.259
Danny Park: Right? I it did surprise me. Right. So if if that is, if that is the truth, or if that's similar in your organization. And again. problems for and Mbas are opportunities, there's a great opportunity to go ahead and start helping out or questioning like, Hey, can I help? Can I help you with building out a data strategy?

457
00:59:32.730 --> 00:59:34.909
Danny Park: Okay, another one.

458
00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:38.839
Danny Park: I don't see often our monetization models

459
00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:48.119
Danny Park: right? Meaning like, Wa, like, how you? How are you going to market to sell it? Right? Are you gonna sell it just raw.

460
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:56.090
Danny Park: Right? It just comes out of your system and you sell it right? Or are you gonna offer data insights?

461
00:59:56.420 --> 01:00:02.029
Danny Park: So you have data or a tool that has world class data insights. And you're going to sell that

462
01:00:02.130 --> 01:00:03.679
Danny Park: that capability

463
01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:13.209
Danny Park: right? Or you're going to create data products. So let's say you, you figured, your company has a really great way of capturing data. So data acquisition.

464
01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:21.849
Danny Park: right? So you want to create a product around and sell and license that product. Great idea. right? And even licensing data.

465
01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:38.320
Danny Park: Right? Like, for example, you know, those like like Bloomberg. right where they, you know, they aggregate market data, and they provide analytics around it. So what Bloomberg does is they sell their analytic capability. But they're buying their data

466
01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:52.639
Danny Park: where they're licensing the data that they get from other source companies. So there's companies that generating financial data. And they say, and Bloomberg, Bloomberg says, Hey, I need to buy your data cause if I don't buy your data.

467
01:00:53.020 --> 01:01:05.189
Danny Park: I can't sell the analytics because I don't have data. So let me buy your data. And the company says, Okay, I'll sell you my data. What form do you want it raw, or do you want it pre-processed? How do you want it? And

468
01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.890
Danny Park: how you gonna pay me? You gonna license it.

469
01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:26.939
Danny Park: or you're just gonna just buy bulk. And whatever what's the agreement there? And then? Then the company sells data to Bloomberg. Bloomberg takes the data that they purchased. They go and run the analytics, and they create their industry reports. And they sell that report out to market. And that's how they generate the revenue, so their cost of sales will be the data, purchase.

470
01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:40.120
Danny Park: the cost of the data purchase and their revenue. The product is the analytical report right? So if we think about this, now, think about like, we could just start imagining. Wow, like how often data is sold

471
01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:43.029
Danny Park: and and repackaged in a different way.

472
01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:47.490
Danny Park: right?

473
01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:55.499
Danny Park: And if you think about it, there may many companies. Can they have options? So they did their data. They just haven't really thought about doing it.

474
01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:56.970
Danny Park: Okay.

475
01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:02.790
Danny Park:  last thing I'll kind of pick on here a little bit.

476
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:05.660
Danny Park: right? Is a data pricing strategy.

477
01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:10.859
Danny Park: right? And the reason why I pick on it a little bit is because.

478
01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:16.819
Danny Park: like the better quality you have.

479
01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:19.659
Danny Park: the more you can charge.

480
01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:28.099
Danny Park: Right? So this one has a very intimate link to the quality of the data that you have in your organization.

481
01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:32.189
Danny Park: So that's why I wanted to kind of call out the pricing strategy there.

482
01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:34.200
Danny Park: Okay.

483
01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:44.440
Danny Park: alright. Any questions so far on on the essential elements of my, the elements needed to monetize data.

484
01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:53.160
Danny Park: Alright next one.

485
01:02:53.410 --> 01:02:54.300
Danny Park: So

486
01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:57.959
Danny Park: there are 3 general approaches

487
01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:00.039
Danny Park: to monetizing data.

488
01:03:01.130 --> 01:03:03.680
Danny Park: Okay? So the first one is.

489
01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:09.699
Danny Park: you're improving. Right? So monetize. So I kind of wanna take a step back

490
01:03:10.270 --> 01:03:13.060
Danny Park: the definition of monetizing data. Yes.

491
01:03:13.450 --> 01:03:20.469
Danny Park: you sell data. But also, if you use your own data to save money.

492
01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:33.299
Danny Park: we also consider that monetizing your data. Okay, so let's let's open up the definition monetizing data to mean you could sell it, or you could use it to make your own internal profits

493
01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:46.710
Danny Park: by creating some operational efficiency, so that that using data to improve or create some efficiency. Right is called improving data, approve the approach of approving.

494
01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:48.160
Danny Park: improving.

495
01:03:48.250 --> 01:03:56.229
Danny Park: and that is, use data to create efficiencies in order in in order to work cheaper or fast or or faster operations.

496
01:03:56.510 --> 01:04:05.960
Danny Park: Okay. and the value creation process for improving is data creates efficiencies by making operational processes attached, better, faster, and cheaper

497
01:04:06.790 --> 01:04:13.199
Danny Park: right, and you realize that value by eliminating or redirecting slack, which is waste

498
01:04:13.450 --> 01:04:24.539
Danny Park: work. I sorry, which is capacity. So you have more capacity, do more work, more productivity. And here are some examples of companies that have used improving approach to monetize their data.

499
01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:29.939
Danny Park: Right ups is one of them where they use their route data to optimize delivery routes.

500
01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:35.590
Danny Park: I think this is a rumor. I don't know if it's true. I heard that up has only made left turns in the city.

501
01:04:35.610 --> 01:04:46.509
Danny Park: but they found that the way the the New York City blocks are, or organized that they can get to the same spot quicker if they just kept making left turns due to the traffic in the city.

502
01:04:46.590 --> 01:04:56.099
Danny Park: I don't know if that's true, but it would be great if if someone can work, if someone can look it out for me. But ups stay 400 million annually.

503
01:04:56.750 --> 01:05:00.470
Danny Park: Columbia sportswear. use package tracking data

504
01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:05.449
Danny Park: to eliminate root cause issues in the supply chain, saving them 27 million dollars

505
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:14.050
Danny Park: and then a healthcare company use it. Data from smart hospital beds to speed up nurse response. Po, response lines at 57. So they're saving a lot

506
01:05:14.810 --> 01:05:17.500
Danny Park: which is immeasurable. That's why you don't see a number

507
01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:20.380
Danny Park: attached to that. That 57% metric.

508
01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:33.409
Danny Park: Another approach is wrapping. Wrapping is when you create data, fueled product features and experiences to increase customer value so that customers want to buy more payment

509
01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:37.740
Danny Park: right? In other words, you're you have a product

510
01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:44.529
Danny Park: that's in market. and you're infusing it with some kind of data capability that is so useful

511
01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:53.579
Danny Park: that the client or customer is going to want to buy more of your product or actually pay more for it, so you could increase the price on them

512
01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:57.930
Danny Park: right as examples of wrapping

513
01:05:58.330 --> 01:06:08.420
Danny Park: your data into a product to increase the product value by Schindler. Is it elevated company? Right? They. They provide

514
01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:13.200
Danny Park: performance dashboards for the building main, the elevated maintenance people

515
01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:16.319
Danny Park: to monitor elevated performance

516
01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:29.250
Danny Park: right in a very busy building. Well, pre covid right pre covid the logistics around the engineering around elevators and how efficient they are was a really big time and money saving

517
01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:33.920
Danny Park: endeavor right? Not much so now, because

518
01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:37.150
Danny Park: I don't think anyone goes to office all right.

519
01:06:37.350 --> 01:06:49.300
Danny Park: Another example. World bank, World Bank provides contributing governments with portals to monitor how their donations are achieving their desired philanthropic goals. So this actually benefits World Bank in both in 2 ways. One.

520
01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:55.340
Danny Park: it's it's helping their. The governments

521
01:06:55.470 --> 01:07:00.209
Danny Park: keep track of where the donations are being spent for compliance purposes.

522
01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:05.040
Danny Park: and also because of the transparency and trust, the World Bank gets more donations.

523
01:07:05.890 --> 01:07:30.459
Danny Park: right? So they actually gained a competitive advantage against some other charities or Ngos, because if you're a government, and and you know, like voters are gonna want to know where your the money is going? Who do you want to give your money to, or their money to actually the voters, money or citizens money. We're gonna give the citizens money to the Ngo or not profit or charity that is fully transparent, and showing you where they're spending your money

524
01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:43.390
Danny Park: for the right reasons or the charity. That's just gonna take your money and not tell you where to go, where it's going. right? So no brainer there and then pampers developed sensors to attach diapers that send mobile alerts via app

525
01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:48.380
Danny Park: to parents when the diaper is wet. I wish I had that when my children were younger.

526
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:56.269
Danny Park: right? But another example of wrapping a data capability into a product to achieve

527
01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:58.200
Danny Park: increase sales

528
01:07:58.310 --> 01:08:05.930
Danny Park: and or higher profits. And the last one we talked about earlier. Right? Last approach to monetize data is selling

529
01:08:06.450 --> 01:08:21.709
Danny Park: exchange of information solution of a sum form of money. So when we talk about selling, you get selling raw data or selling the analytics, right? So I use Bloomberg as an example, Bloomberg sells news data and trading tools through a subscription service. So basically, they're selling their analytical

530
01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:23.430
Danny Park: capabilities

531
01:08:24.770 --> 01:08:27.890
Danny Park: from the data that they buy or collect

532
01:08:27.930 --> 01:08:31.250
Danny Park: 2 subscribers. Right? That's best of us here.

533
01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:43.300
Danny Park: right? Erie purchased point of sales data from retailers and in turn sold aggregated data and analytics back to the retailer. So what in this business model? What they did was

534
01:08:43.649 --> 01:08:49.439
Danny Park: Erie says, Hey, I'm gonna buy your data. Okay, cool, perfect. Here his data right? Boom. I bought it.

535
01:08:49.710 --> 01:08:53.090
Danny Park: Then they were like, wait a minute. What if I aggregate

536
01:08:53.779 --> 01:09:06.190
Danny Park: data from all the retailers? I just bought aggregate the data, the analytics behind it. I'm going to be able to tell the same retailer that bought the data from where they are at market, meaning how competitive they are.

537
01:09:07.149 --> 01:09:10.429
Danny Park: right. So they are able to not only recoup

538
01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:21.500
Danny Park: the money that they bought, I mean the money they spent on the data they purchased from retailers. They actually sold it back to the retailers by doing analytics which increased the value of the data

539
01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:30.930
Danny Park: like as a good, as a really great example, and then credit card monitoring services, right.

540
01:09:31.210 --> 01:09:32.819
Danny Park: really common.

541
01:09:35.189 --> 01:09:38.720
Danny Park: Alright. So together these 3

542
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.889
Danny Park: approaches together are known as the improve wrap cell framework.

543
01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:55.940
Danny Park: So regardless of industry, business, model size, a geographic location, or strategic intent. Your organization can monetize data using some combination of these 3.

544
01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:58.410
Danny Park: It can

545
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:03.230
Danny Park: right? But it kind of goes back to

546
01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:07.800
Danny Park: data quality. You can't improve. If your quality sucks.

547
01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:14.490
Danny Park: you can't rap if your quality sucks and you certainly can't sell if your quality sucks.

548
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:20.840
Danny Park: So again, data quality is front and center in everything we do in industry. 4

549
01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:42.630
Danny Park: alright, and the last 2 slides not, you know, Ver. Pretty much common sense, like, you know, the organizational capabilities that we need or the capabilities that we need in our organization to to collect data, to use data to transform data to transmit data, all those things right. Just listed here.

550
01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:48.209
Danny Park: Not a big deal on the exam. Not gonna really cover it on the exam, just for us to read and take a look at

551
01:10:49.530 --> 01:10:53.580
Danny Park: right. I did highlight 15 in red.

552
01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:56.240
Danny Park: because

553
01:10:58.030 --> 01:11:07.540
Danny Park: it's very important that when we think about capability or organizational capability. sometimes many companies forget

554
01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:15.870
Danny Park: to assess the capability of third party vendors and partners. Right? Cause. I've seen enough instances where

555
01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:19.580
Danny Park: a organization will collect a particular type of data

556
01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:33.159
Danny Park: just to find out that the third party vendor or a partner doesn't have the capability to use that data to transform the data, to to provide analytics like literally like they just weren't ready for it.

557
01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:38.949
Danny Park: So the cost of gaining or collecting that data in the first place, with some cost.

558
01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:48.110
Danny Park: Okay, so 15 is a very important thing that we just have to remind ourselves that when we talk about capability it extends to who we are partnering with

559
01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:57.749
Danny Park: alright. And then last slide. This is not a cyber security course. So we're not. We're not gonna talk about too much. But just

560
01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:58.850
Danny Park: point is

561
01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:05.630
Danny Park: you have to have the right data. I mean the right technologies in place.

562
01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:17.699
Danny Park: right to be able to process your data and definitely have the right protocols, procedures, methodologies, frameworks and technologies in place to safeguard your data

563
01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:31.349
Danny Park: right? It's no brainer. So just providing this out, there won't no specifics on of Slide 19 and 20 will be on the exam. But just showing just for those who want to, or just in kind of getting a little bit deeper into the details.

564
01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:34.290
Danny Park: Alright

565
01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:39.840
Danny Park: awesome. With that, said, I think that's all the content for today, any questions

566
01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:43.309
Danny Park: from anyone on anything we covered so far.

567
01:12:48.710 --> 01:12:50.910
Danny Park: Oh, Kai

568
01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:56.630
Kai-Shih Wang: Kai, she sorry if I mess that up. Yeah, I go by Kai Kai. Okay? Perfect. Okay

569
01:12:56.820 --> 01:13:04.039
Kai-Shih Wang: for so-called. The Bloomberg example was inspiring. And I was wondering, since Brundler

570
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:12.660
Kai-Shih Wang: purchase data pecks from other companies, how does ensure the conformity and accuracy

571
01:13:12.850 --> 01:13:20.319
Danny Park: of the data acquired. Yeah, great question. And guess what? They'll never let us know. Cause that's one of the competitive advantages.

572
01:13:21.970 --> 01:13:26.000
Danny Park: So. And that's you. But you put up a great point right

573
01:13:26.650 --> 01:13:30.580
Danny Park: when you're in the business. Now with selling data and selling analytics.

574
01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:43.490
Danny Park: the methods and practices you have to ensure that your data is of top quality. That is not a competitive advantage, and you do not want to share that with anybody.

575
01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:46.530
Danny Park: because data is so prevalent.

576
01:13:47.050 --> 01:13:50.889
Danny Park: right that someone could just come in and replicate what you're doing.

577
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:52.320
Danny Park: So

578
01:13:52.890 --> 01:14:00.590
Danny Park: the the actual business of selling and buying data. It causes data's quality to become a now

579
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:11.260
Danny Park: strategic business element that in itself is going to become a competitive edge. Now, now let's think about this. Now, in the world of AI right

580
01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:14.250
Danny Park: to get useful. AI. It

581
01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:19.249
Danny Park: clearly 100 depends on the quality of the data that that we are teaching it with.

582
01:14:19.850 --> 01:14:23.859
Danny Park: So if if Elon is using

583
01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:25.539
Danny Park: is building AI.

584
01:14:25.570 --> 01:14:37.019
Danny Park: Why would he ever share how he's training his met his AI mechanisms? How is cleaning, transforming his data? How is quality checking his data with Microsoft or Google.

585
01:14:37.950 --> 01:14:39.050
Danny Park: He won't

586
01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:45.580
Danny Park: unless there's a strategic advantage with partnering with Microsoft, Google anywhere, or some of the other vendors.

587
01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:54.470
Danny Park: And that's opportunity for everyone in this room who wants to get into the the business of data?

588
01:14:55.110 --> 01:15:01.830
Danny Park: Right? It's it's a it's a. It's going to be a beautiful world out there for a rich of opportunities for many Mbas.

589
01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:08.850
Danny Park: Oh, great question, Kai. I know I didn't answer your question directly, but I hope I did answer your question in a in a in a certain way.

590
01:15:09.710 --> 01:15:13.650
Danny Park: Okay, you're welcome, alright, awesome.

591
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:15.520
Danny Park: alright. Any other questions

592
01:15:18.710 --> 01:15:28.499
Paola Henriquez: I do have a question it's not direct to directly to the class. But it's mostly that I did notice that I'm not in any group.

593
01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:53.239
Danny Park: Oh, I was registering late. Oh, yes, I will. I will add you after this call. So I'll just tell you on Group 2. So so group 2, please chat. Paula. Yeah. You know, like your Whatsapp, whatever you guys use to communicate. And then I'll update the

594
01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:56.649
Danny Park: The team assignments are posting a blackboard later this week.

595
01:15:56.830 --> 01:15:59.800
Danny Park: Okay, thank you. Awesome. No, thank you. Alright.

596
01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:15.049
michael amuev: Alright awesome. If there are no other questions, only a minute. Oh, okay, go ahead, Michael. Yeah. Do we have any upcoming deadlines that we should be aware of in terms of case studies being due, or any project upcoming, or the midterm.

597
01:16:15.510 --> 01:16:22.310
Danny Park: No, everything's on the schedule as as relates deadlines and things like that. You're welcome.

598
01:16:22.730 --> 01:16:27.709
Jie Yang: Hi, Professor. Yeah, I just found out I I'm not in any group, either.

599
01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:36.370
Danny Park: Oh, you're in Group 3. So anyone else, neither group. If you're not, you're in Group 4.

600
01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:47.660
